  "narrator_prompt": "The far trader Autumn Gold settles onto the landing pad with a familiar shudder. Through the viewports, Walston stretches out - brown and grey beneath a thin atmosphere. The starport is modest, almost rustic. A few prefab buildings, a fuel depot, not much else. Locals in traditional kilts go about their business, paying the arriving ship little mind. This is a quiet world. What could possibly go wrong?"
