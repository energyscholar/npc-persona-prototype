        CUTTING TORCH
        A basic cutting tool using incandescent gas fed by a                                                Chainsaw
        heavy canister. Cutting torches are effective against
        most metals and alloys but will not work on starship hulls
        or armoured vehicles constructed at TL10 or higher. The
        improved cutting torch will cut through materials below
        TL14; those constructed of bonded superdense at TL14
        and above require laser cutters or drills.

        ELECTRIC WELDING KIT
        A basic arc welding kit useful for many light applications.
        It is self-powered from batteries but requires an external
        power source for big jobs. Arc welding gear is really
        only useful on devices built prior to TL10. The advanced
        welding kit is necessary for work on materials of TL10 or
        higher, otherwise weld points become a serious area of
        weakness and in some cases will not ‘take’ at all.                               Electric Welding Kit
