                RADIATION SUIT
                An NBC suit will protect the Traveller against
                contamination from irradiated particles such as
                dust but offers little or no protection against direct
                radiation such as solar flares or a reactor breach. A
                vacc suit will offer some protection but for areas of
                hard radiation a dedicated radiation suit is required,
                reducing exposure by 100 rads. Radiation suits
                become more protective at higher Tech Levels, adding
                10 rads of protection for each TL above 6.

                Radiation suits do not protect against vacuum or
                underwater environments but include the capabilities of an
                environment suit (see page 29) and can accommodate life
                support masks, oxygen tanks and rebreathers.

                REBREATHER
                The rebreather is a bulky backpack containing
                breathable atmospheric tanks and face mask that
                collect exhaled gases and ‘scrub’ them into breathable
                air. A rebreather provides six hours of breathable               Radiation Suit
                atmosphere and can be used in any environment that
                is not otherwise harmful, such as being underwater.
                At each TL above 6, the rebreather can sustain life for
                another hour. If a user remains motionless or practices
                minimal exertion, the rebreather may be able to sustain
                life up to twice its rated duration.

Survival gear




                This mask concentrates inhaled oxygen, allowing a user
                to breathe in worlds with Very Thin (3) Atmospheres.
                Respirators take the form of a face mask or mouthpiece
                initially. More advanced respirators are small enough to
                fit into the nose or can even be a lung implant.
