                A nylon suit that gives the wearer an artificial version
                of patagia (flaps that allow gliding and limited ‘flight’),
                the squirrel suit slows down falling descent by half and
                can be used with Athletics (dexterity) to fly horizontally
                while gliding to the ground. A squirrel suit should be
                paired with a parachute or parawing for emergencies
                and final descent, or the user will suffer half falling
                damage on landing. Squirrel suits require at least a Thin
                atmosphere to function safely. Glide ratios (the horizontal
                distance covered while falling) vary from 4:1 for Dense                              Breather Mask
                atmospheres, 3:1 for Standard, to 2:1 for Thin. Squirrel
                suits are not available for Very Thin atmospheres

                BREATHER MASK
                A combination of both filter mask and respirator, which
                allows breathing of Very Thin and/or Tainted (2, 3, 4, 7,
                9) Atmospheres. The TL10 version is small enough to
                fit into the nose or can even be a lung implant.

Survival gear




                An environment mask functions in the same way
                as the breather mask but is also designed to fit
                seamlessly with NBC or environment suiting,
                creating a sealed environment for the user and
                thus protecting against chemical and biological
                threats. The environment mask is designed to allow
                communications devices to be used and includes
                drinking apparatus (a flexible straw). An environment
                mask will not function in vacuum or underwater.
