     COMPUTERS AND SOFTWARE
     Any technological society runs on computers, with
     access to them as basic as the right to air and water.
     To those both knowledgeable and skilled, they open
     an array of possibilities in all areas of life and having       SHIP-BASED COMPUTERS

     Beyond TL8, the storage capacity of even a modest
     computer is effectively unlimited.
