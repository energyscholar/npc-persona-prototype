           NET
           This is a large net, usually with weights fastened
           to its extremities. It is thrown over a target with the
           intention of entangling them. A person hit by a net
           does not sustain any damage. Instead, they must
           make a Melee (unarmed) check opposed by the                                                       Sling
           Athletics (dexterity) check of the attacker, as if being
           grappled. If failed, the defender is immobilised. The
           defender can escape the net by making a successful
           Average (8+) DEX check (1D rounds).

           A projectile weapon which propels small stones or metal
           bullets using rotational energy. Slings are powerful but
           require a certain amount of skill to use effectively.
