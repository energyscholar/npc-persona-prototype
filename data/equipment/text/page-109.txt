                PURIFICATION TABLETS
                These small, chalky white tablets are stored in waxed
                paper envelopes to keep them from being exposed
                to airborne humidity. When dropped in a container of
                water (one tablet per four litres) there is a powerful
                effervescent reaction. A foam forms and traps all
                natural impurities before rising to the top of the water
                to be poured or scraped off. While these tablets will
                not neutralise poison or radiation, they are essential to
                eliminate natural bacteria and pollutants. The advanced
                versions will filter any liquid that is at least 80% water
                (one tablet needed for every 10 litres) and all radiation,
                poison, additives or the intoxicating alcohol in a liquid
                will be instantly nullified and sublimated as pops of
                bubbles on the surface.

                RAD BLANKET
                This heavy plasticised sheet of lead fibres blocks
                most radiation that strikes it, saving anyone or thing
                sheltered beneath. All sources of rads being applied
                to objects beneath the blanket are reduced by 2D x 10
                rads. A rad-blanket folds into a roughly cubic package
                that is about 50 centimetres in height, width, and depth.
