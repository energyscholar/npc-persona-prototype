A fission microreactor will not scale smaller than
Medium size but will provide power with little need for
maintenance for up to 25 years. These reactors have
severely restricted availability on most worlds, as their
components are extremely hazardous, although their
fuel is not nearly enriched enough to build a nuclear
bomb. After 20 + 1D years, these reactors will need
maintenance and refuelling, requiring 1D weeks and
50% of their initial cost in parts and fuel.

off water electrolysed into hydrogen and expels
oxygen as a waste gas. It does not require or support
external fuel tanks, as its fuel supply is constantly
run through a series of cooling and generating tubes
to provide fusion at relatively low temperatures. The
water doubles as radiation shielding and accounts
for half the mass of the reactor. Oxygen is the only
waste product, expelled gradually over the generator’s
period of operation. Deuterium-enriched water,
available for Cr500 per recharge, will increase the
generator’s operating duration by a factor of 10 before
it requires refuelling and maintenance.
