                SPHERE OF SOLACE
                Using active sound-cancelling technology, the sphere
                of solace creates an adjustable area of silence
                through which only the loudest sounds are capable of
                penetrating (if a battle is going on between shipmates
                using the sphere versus the high fidelity music system,
                highest Tech Level will win…). This is used to create a
                zone over up to five metres in radius where a Traveller
                can enjoy both peace and quiet.
