        NAVIGATION TOOL SET
        A navigation tool set is a subset of surveying and
        astronomical tools designed specifically for determining
        location and bearing and is useful for land, sea and
        eventually air navigation. The basic tool set uses
        primitive equipment: an astrolabe, compass and                      Rescue Tool Set
