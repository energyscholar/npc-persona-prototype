         A basic thruster pack gives the Traveller the ability to                           1hr (belt), +8hr (torso)
         manoeuvre in zero-gravity over short distances at an
         Idle speed. An Athletics (dexterity) check is required
         to use a thruster pack accurately. Basic thruster
         packs can only be used in microgravity environments.
         Improved thruster packs allow 0.1G acceleration for up
         to 48 hours, using standard starship fuel. The advanced
         pack uses grav-thruster plates but has the same
         performance profile as the improved version.

         Available for tailored and light-duty vacc suits, the
         accessory pack contains a solid helmet and semi-
         rigid torso piece which provides additional armour
         protection (Protection +6 to suits with less inherent
         armour), although this is intended to protect against
         micrometeorites and some radiation.                                                             Thruster Pack
