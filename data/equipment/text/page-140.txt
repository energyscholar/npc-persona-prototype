                                                     MONOFILAMENT GARROTTE
                                                     A piece of monofilament wire which spools from two
                                                     handles. It attacks as a standard garrotte but causes
                                                     3D damage on consecutive rounds, often decapitating
                                                     the victim. Mishaps can cause harm to the wielder,
                                                     accidently severing a hand or worse.

                                                     PISTON FIST
                                                     This heavy metal forearm brace has a built-in
                                                     pneumatic ram that activates whenever the wielder
                                                     makes a quick punching motion. Driven forward under
                                                     great pressure, it has the potential to punch through
                                                     solid walls. The wielder’s STR DM is never added to
                                    Claw Glove       the damage caused by this weapon.

                                                     STUNFIST
                                                     A stunfist is a high-technology knuckleduster containing
                                                     a shock unit (along with insulation for the wearer) that
                                                     incapacitates the victim rather than pummels them.
