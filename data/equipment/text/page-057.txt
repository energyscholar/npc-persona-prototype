           At TL11, internal chemical pumps and fatigue-resistant
           fibres are added, greatly increasing ground speed
           and agility. This augment adds three metres to the
           distance the Traveller moves with a Minor Action and
           all checks based on balance or ambulatory reflexes
           are made with DM+2.

           At TL13, this augment is made from superior materials
           designed to maximise efficiency and stability. This
           adds six metres to the distance the Traveller moves
           with a Minor Action and all checks based on balance or
           ambulatory reflexes are made with DM+3.
