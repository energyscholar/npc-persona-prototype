SLOW DRUG
This is a variant of the metabolic accelerator. It can
only be applied safely in a medical facility where life-
support and cryotechnology is available, as it increases
the metabolism and aging to around 30 times normal
for one day, allowing a patient to undergo a month
of healing in a single day. Using this drug outside
of a hospital or sickbay is a messy and painful way
to commit suicide, as the user will rapidly cook their
internal organs and suffer massive brain damage. A
user on unsupervised Slow Drug lapses into feverish
unconsciousness within 1D rounds and will begin
