GRAPNEL AND CABLE
A hooked device used to attach a rope for climbing
purposes, plus 10 metres of stout cord (100kg load).
Grapnels can be thrown or propelled by a grapnel
launcher. Getting one to attach itself can be tricky and
requires an Average (8+) DEX check; attaching to
smooth surfaces or trying to get the grapnel to bite into
soil will increase the difficulty.
