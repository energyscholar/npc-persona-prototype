                                ADDICTION AND WITHDRAWAL
                               At the Referee’s discretion, the use of various drugs may cause addiction and lead to dependence, cravings
                               and withdrawal. Besides recreational drugs, likely candidates for addiction include combat drug, meta-
                               performance enhancer, metabolic accelerator, nervous response dampener and stims. Even PSI drugs might
                               be addictive if that is an aspect the Referee wants to explore. These rules are suggested guidelines for the
                               Referee to consider if the negative aspects of drug use are to be part of a campaign.

                               Addiction has two main effects: cravings and withdrawal. Tolerance – the need to take more drugs to achieve
                               the same effect – can also factor in chronic use, although that will require additional recordkeeping. Actual
                               addiction rarely occurs after first use and some habitual users of a drug might avoid addiction altogether but
                               to simulate addiction, the Referee can require an END check to avoid it after a certain number of doses or
                               after a certain number within a constrained time period.

                               Withdrawal is a physical reaction to the absence of the drug to which the Traveller is addicted. This can be a

                               debilitating condition, even fatal in some instances. After a period without any access to the drug, the addicted
                               Traveller in withdrawal must begin making increasingly difficult END checks, with negative Effects causing
                               temporary reduction to END and/or other characteristics. The number and severity of checks required for
                               withdrawal to complete and the time interval between checks is left to the discretion of the Referee but should
                               be consistent for the withdrawal effect for a particular drug, at least across a particular species.

                               Cravings often occur after withdrawal but more often begin long before withdrawal becomes an issue.
                               Cravings are controlled by continued use of the drug. Failure to acquire an adequate supply will tend to result
                               in increasingly erratic behaviour. The optional Fatigue rules presented in the Naval Campaign Sourcebook
                               (page 58) and the Deepnight Revelation Referee Handbook (page 41) can be impacted by this craving, with
                               increasingly negative DMs to avoid Fatigue as time passes. Or the Referee may simply require DM-1 for all
                               checks for every day or week the Traveller goes without the drug. Cravings will cease when the drug is taken
                               again, resetting the clock for both cravings and withdrawal. Cravings will usually, but not necessarily, subside
                               after a longer period of time (months, possibly years) after the last dose was taken.
