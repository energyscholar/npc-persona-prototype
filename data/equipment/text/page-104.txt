HYDRO-COLLECTOR

An oval-shaped bowl sitting atop a wide-footed tripod
nearly a metre tall when extended, the hydro-collector
uses tiny electromagnetic pulses to draw moisture out of
the air and collect it as drinkable water. One eight-hour
collection session will provide an amount of drinking water
depending on the average local atmospheric humidity. In
arid areas this will produce three litres or enough water for
one person-day. In temperate areas, nine litres. In moist
or humid areas, 15 litres. The device is solar powered and
recharges while it is collecting, in most cases.
