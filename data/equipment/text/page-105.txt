                SOLAR VAPORATOR
                A device using solar panels to generate power during
                the day (and storing it in an internal battery) and
                collecting moisture from the air, especially at night. It
                yields two litres of water per 24 hours in Standard or
                Dense atmospheres, one litre in Thin atmospheres, and
                half a litre in Very Thin atmospheres. The vaporator is
                stored in a compact (50 x 20 x 20 centimetres) package
                and is unfolded for use. It can be considered an extra-
                small solar panel array (see page 119).

                sustenance. A human Traveller in the field will require
                at least three litres of water and two units of caloric-
                dense (often dehydrated) sustenance per day. Heavy
                exertion, extreme heat or cold and other factors may
                increase these requirements by a factor of two or more.

                BACKPACK
                A basic carrying bag with shoulder straps and external
                pockets. Most backpacks have an internal capacity of 30–
                60 litres volume and can support double that volume of
                items with external straps or clips. From TL6, backpacks
                are more waterproof, enough to keep the contents dry
                during a brief immersion if properly sealed. A Bivvy pack is
                available at TL7, which includes a waterproof blanket and
                hood that fold out of the lining, allowing the emptied pack                               Duct Tape
                to be used as a sleeping bag or ready-made bivouac.
