                     Opener             A handheld reaction jet using compressed gas, the
                                        thrust pistol allows independent manoeuvre in zero-G
                                        vacuum conditions. The pistol’s internal reserves allow
                                        for an hour of moderate manoeuvring or three minutes
                                        of continuous thrust at 0.1G acceleration for one
                                        person with vacc suit and equipment.

                                        VACC EMERGENCY KIT
                                        A belt-carried pack, this emergency kit is designed
                                        to allow a vacc suited user to save themselves or
                                        someone else in the event of an accident and to
                                        increase the chances of a search finding them. Yanking
                                        a lanyard releases a tethered balloon reflector. This is
                                        somewhat similar to a rescue bubble but filled at very
Personal                                low pressure. It inflates into a three-metre-diameter
Re-Entry Kit                            radar reflector which is tethered to the user’s belt. It
                                        vastly increases the user’s radar cross-section and
                                        makes a search more likely to find them. The kit
                                        contains a radio beacon/repeater, a handheld strobe
                                        beacon, tethering cord, suit patches, spray sealant
                                        for multiple small holes, a 30-minute replacement air
                                        bottle and two hand-held gas thruster units. The latter
                                        are designed to allow the stranded Traveller a last-
                                        ditch attempt to reach safety in zero-G conditions.
                                        The kit also contains a metallic reflectorised blanket
                                        which increases radar detection and reduces absorbed
                                        radiation by 100 rads in the event the user is caught
                                        outside in a solar flare.
