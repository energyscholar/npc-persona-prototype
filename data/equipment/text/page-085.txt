                HOME THEATRE
                Once Travellers have settled into their home and
                purchased a music system, a home theatre is often
                the next thing on the list, allowing them to watch the
                latest vids as the directors truly intended (so they tell
                themselves). Even with the appearance of technologies
                such as flat and flexible screens, a home theatre
                is a bulky item up to TL8. At TL9, screens can be
                ‘painted’ or ‘pasted’ onto a wall or other flat surface
                and combined with powerful but low profile speakers,            MINIATURES WARGAME
