VENOM GLANDS
This bionic augment requires the insertion of toxic
salivary glands into the jawbone, making the saliva a
potent necrotic toxin. The Traveller inflicts an additional
D+3 points of damage whenever successfully biting a
living creature. Users are immune to their own venom
and bite victims with divergent biochemistries may not
necessarily be affected by these glands.

WAFER JACK
A wafer jack is a computer system implanted into the
base of the skull that contains a physical data socket
and a processor running an interface program. A
Traveller with a wafer jack can use Expert programs
for tasks relying on INT or EDU only. The main benefit
is that it is much smaller and more discrete than
a portable computer and the user can access the
Expert program by thought alone. A wafer jack has
a specialised Computer/2 for Expert programs only,
always running Intelligence Interface.

The wafer jack’s Intelligence Interface does not use                                                            Augments
any Bandwidth, so all available computer Bandwidth
may be used for running one or two Expert software
packages. Total storage capacity of physical data
wafers is indicated by the wafer jack’s total Bandwidth.
Swapping out software is done with physical media and
not possible in the heat of the moment.

The advanced wafer jack has a specialised Computer/3
capable of simultaneously running one, two or three
Expert packages of total Bandwidth 3.
