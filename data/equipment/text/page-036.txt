POWERED SUITS
There is a class of armoured suit falling between
unpowered combat armour and the extremely                                                        Ceramic
advanced battle dress rigs; these are collectively                                               Powered Plate
called powered suits. Aided by servos, pneumatics and
counterweight mechanisms, powered suits enhance
the wearer’s strength at the cost of limited use between
refuelling or charging. Powered suits, if sealed, offer
total protection from gas and airborne biological agents
as well as ample radiation shielding.

While powered and active, the mass of a powered
suit does not count against the encumbrance of the
wearer and is effectively weightless. When a powered
suit is not charged or fuelled, the mass of the suit
does impair the wearer. Additionally, any STR bonus
the armour provides is lost and any DEX penalty the
armour imposes is doubled.

Unless otherwise stated, powered suits come equipped
with the electronics suite appropriate to their Tech
Level, as shown on page 27. Most are considered
Category 4 items; the only exceptions being the simple
exoskeleton and expensive, difficult to operate extreme
environment exploration suit.


Ceramic Powered Plate: An advanced version of
powered plate, made of advanced ceramic-metal hybrid
alloys, this armoured suit has a higher rate of protection
against lasers, flamethrowers and other heat or fire-
based attacks. Also, while the suit is running on its 85
hour power cell (Cr250 to replace), it adds STR+2 to the
Traveller but inflicts a DEX-2 penalty.
