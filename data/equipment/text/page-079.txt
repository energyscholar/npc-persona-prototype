              SENSORS
              Most sensors are designed to be plugged into a                                                    Bug

              BIOSCANNER
              The bioscanner ‘sniffs’ for organic molecules and tests
              chemical samples, analysing the make-up of whatever
              it is focused on. It can be used to detect poisons or
              bacteria, analyse organic matter, search for life signs
              and classify unfamiliar organisms.

              This handheld device scans a location for
              electromagnetic signatures from hidden microphones,
              cameras, microrobots and other surveillance devices.
              The difference between the detector’s Tech Level and
              that of the ‘bug’ provides positive DM to any Electronics
              (sensors) check. The check to detect an actively
              transmitting device is Average (8+) but for passive
              devices, it is a Very Difficult (12+) check. The bug
              detector has a range of six metres. A more expensive
              version provides a DM+2 to detection attempts. These
              are often installed room-by-room in secure facilities as
              part of an overall security system.

              DENSITOMETER
              The densitometer uses an object’s natural gravity
              to measure its density, building a three-dimensional
              image of the object. This portable densitometer’s range
              depends on the mass of the object being scanned. A
              detailed scan of a person-sized object is possible at
              100 metres, while a small starship or building can be            Metal Detector
              scanned more than a kilometre distant, even through
              intervening obstacles.
