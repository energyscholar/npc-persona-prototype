Prototech Quirks
1D Quirk
1      Unreliable after prolonged use: After any skill check resulting in 2, or a result of 2 or less on 2D after every
       24 hours of use, the item becomes unreliable until ‘cooled down’ or repaired. If already unreliable, apply
       DM-1 to task checks and halve any time interval between periodic failure checks.
2      Especially massive: Double the item’s mass.
3      Especially expensive: Double the item’s cost.
4      Especially difficult to operate or repair: Skill checks suffer an additional DM-1.
5      Item is ‘noisy’: The item is either very noticeable with DM+2 on Recon or sensor checks to detect, or its
       operation causes discomfort to the operator and others nearby because of noise, smell or visual effects,
       causing DM-2 to task checks from all nearby personnel without appropriate sensory protection.
6      Item is not durable: After one year, the item becomes permanently unreliable. If already unreliable, subtract
       a further DM-1 to task checks and halve any time interval between failures.
