                 A transceiver is a stand-alone communications device,
                 in other words a two-way radio. Unlike a mobile comm,          Laser transceivers require line-of-sight to operate and

                 To reach orbital ranges reliably, a transceiver
                 requires a range of 500 kilometres. With increasing            Laser transceivers decrease in mass and cost like other
                 Tech Levels, transceivers tend to become both                  electronic devices but the higher Tech Level versions
