         Civilian suits provide armour protection but their
         main function is to protect a Traveller from a hostile
         environment. In most instances, these suits do not
         require special permits or certifications to purchase,
         although the explosive ordinance disposal suit occupies
         a grey area between civilian and military use.


          Emergency Hostile Environment Suit: A
          disposable emergency vacc suit is designed to protect
          the Traveller from corrosive, insidious and similarly
          hazardous atmospheres (and, of course, vacuum).
          The suit is good for six to eight hours in hazardous
          environments, after which there is a one in six (non-
          cumulative) chance it will fail every hour. Emergency
          suits are carried by starships to allow engineering crew
          to make emergency repairs under unusual conditions.
          The suit can be refurbished for Cr6000 but each
          refurbishment inflicts DM-1 to the chance of failure
          after the ‘safe’ time and reduces possible failure time
          by one hour. Once the failure chance has reached
          four in six, the suit is too degraded to be of use. An
          electronics suite is not included but there is an integral
          six-hour life support system.
