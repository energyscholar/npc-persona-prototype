     Audio: The bug records anything it hears.
     Visual: The bug records anything it sees.
     Data: If attached to a computer system, the bug can
     search and copy data from the computer. The bug
     cannot breach computer security on its own but if a
     user accesses the computer in the bug’s presence, the
     bug can read the data.
     Bioscan: The bug has a basic biological scanner, allowing
     it to sample the area for DNA traces, chemical taint and so                                         Commdot
