                                                       A set of short-range holographic projectors woven
                                                       into a face-covering net can completely transform a
                                                       person’s appearance. Placed over the head, this net,
                                   Disguise Kit        originally developed to produce ‘virtual hair’, can mim-

                                                       creating holographic features that float just above
                                                       the surface of the net. The net will almost always fool
                                                       even very close visual inspection but is easily detect-
                                                       able by electronic means. A whole body version is
                                                       also available; it can be worn above clothing and will
                                                       completely transform the body. As the net closely fol-
                                                       lows the contours of a real face or body, alternations
                                                       are limited to beings of the same general size and
                                                       shape – slightly larger is possible; smaller is not. The
                                                       net includes batteries to maintain the disguise for a full
                                                       day, with wireless recharging possible.

                                                       stateroom or similar area, the environment replicator
                                                       automatically adjusts lighting, temperature and
                                                       humidity to recreate that found on specific worlds.
                                                       This is usually done to make Travellers feel more
