                A power cell is a rechargeable store of energy, either                                      years
                taken from a local grid or produced by portable
                generators. It may use battery, fuel cell or another
                technology but is a self-contained unit with inverters and
                output plugs to allow the charging of buildings, lights,
                portable electronics and similar devices. A power cell
                unit stores enough energy to provide Medium power
                for one hour or Extra-Small power for a full day but will
                last longer if used intermittently. A power cell’s efficiency
                refers to what percentage of input from the power
                sources is available for output from the power cell.
