      SPECIALISED AMMUNITION
      The weapons specialist knows a bullet is never just a
      bullet. One advantage slug throwers have over energy
      weapons is that their ammunition can be customised,
      often heavily, to achieve specific desired outcomes            AMMUNITION-SPECIFIC WEAPONS
      (which normally result in a dead enemy). As the size          A weapon must have a listed magazine cost in
      of the shell increases, so do the options available,          order to be able to use the ammunition in this

      Every type of ammunition in this chapter includes a           Shot Pistol
      table describing the weapons it is likely to be available
      for. The Referee can use this as a guideline. Unless          To use a particular modification, the weapon
      specifically indicated, any single round of ammunition        firing it must be manufactured at a Tech Level

      ARMOUR PIERCING
      These rounds are pointed projectiles of dense or very
      hard material designed to punch through armour. AP
      ammunition provides a weapon with an AP trait equal to
      the number of damage dice it rolls. If the weapon already
      has the AP trait, this is added to the final AP score.
