                visible from the air. The primary drawbacks of this form
                of signalling are the short duration of the coloured
                patch (which lasts around 15 minutes in calm waters
                and far less in stormy weather) and the fact it cannot be
                spotted at night. At TL9, the latter problem is overcome
                by using a phosphorescent dye which is visible both at
                day and at night.
