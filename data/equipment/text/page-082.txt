For many a Traveller, the most important part of a home                          appearance
is where they sleep, a good night’s rest being directly
connected to one’s success in the field. Many choose a
simple mattress-based bed, although those purchased

than the standard stateroom model. Others prefer
hammocks, which have the advantage of keeping the

CLOTHING CONSULTANT

limited artificial intelligence, the clothing consultant
