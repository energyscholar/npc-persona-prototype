           SHIELDS
           A Traveller using a standard shield increases their
           effective Melee skill by +1 when parrying. A Traveller
           with no Melee skill counts as having Melee 0 when
           using a shield to parry. If used as a weapon instead,
           they require the Melee (bludgeon) skill.

           BOARDING SHIELD
           Used by shipboard security personnel and law
           enforcement special-response teams, the boarding
           shield is a large movable obstacle. It cannot be used
           to parry but instead provides the wielder with cover
           (Protection +8, see page 77 of the Traveller Core
           Rulebook for the effects of cover). Most boarding
           shields have a vision slit or firing port in the front
           surface. A boarding shield completely protects anyone
           hiding behind it and is large enough for two people
           to benefit from it simultaneously or to move it forward                       Buckler
           while remaining covered.

           BUCKLER
           A small wood and metal shield held in the hand and
                                                                                             Expandable Shield
           used to parry incoming blows. A buckler requires skill
           to use effectively. It acts as a shield but does not
           grant an effective Melee 0 if the wielder has no skill
           in Melee to begin with.

           EXPANDABLE SHIELD
           An expandable shield deploys from a bracer on the
           wearer’s forearm. Using morphable materials, it
           expands on voice or electronic command to become
           any size from a buckler to a boarding shield, providing
           Protection +8 as cover but it is lightweight enough to
           not be considered bulky in that role.

           GRAVITIC SHIELD
           Worn as an armband or bracer, when activated the
           gravitic shield projects a flat, shimmering energy field                 Gravitic Shield
           that deflects incoming attacks and functions in the
Weaponry




           same way as a normal shield.
