ARCTIC AND COLD ENVIRONMENTS
Travellers, at least humans, cannot survive long in cold
environments. As noted on page 82 in the Traveller               Heatsuit
Core Rulebook, lack of protection in the cold will
eventually cause damage to unprotected Travellers.

COLD WEATHER CLOTHING
A set of heavy outer garments designed to protect
the wearer from extremely cold temperatures. Natural
materials are used at lower Tech Levels. Higher-tech
clothing is less bulky and protects the wearer better.
The clothing reduces the damage from arctic conditions
to 1D every four hours (see page 82 of the Traveller
Core Rulebook) and the time between damage rolls
increases by two hours per TL above 0. The clothing
is quite clumsy at low Tech Levels, inflicting a DEX-1
penalty but usability improves as it advances.

HEATSUIT
A coverall-like garment incorporating battery-powered
heater coils. The heatsuit eliminates the ill effects of
temperatures down to -60ºC. It is not damaged by
immersion in water but will not function while the wearer
is immersed. The battery lasts 12 hours and can be
recharged or replaced. The suit can also be directly
powered from the output socket of a small power source.

ICE AXE
A small axe optimised for digging into ice when
                                                                                         Survival gear
climbing. It adds DM+2 to any check involving
climbing or arresting a fall on ice. Treat as a hatchet
(see page 134) in combat.
