                                        INFINITE ROPE
                                        Stored in liquid form within a device looking like a caulk
                                        gun, infinite rope is a bacterium binding to itself with
                                        amazing strength and flexibility. When needed, the
                                        trigger on the ‘gun’ is pulled and a length of rope will be
                         Folding cage   produced, instantly toughening. The dispenser has a
                                        shutter that allows for the rope to then be cut and used
                                        as normal. When finished, however, the rope can be
                                        balled up and reloaded into the gun to be digested by
                                        the bacterium colony and re-used later. A single infinite
                                        rope dispenser can produce up to 26 metres of rope
                                        before running out and must have at least one metre’s
                                        worth of colony left inside to reclaim old rope (a readout

                                        kilograms without showing stress or tearing.
