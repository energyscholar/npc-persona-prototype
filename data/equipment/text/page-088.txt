VR HELMET
A VR helmet allows for deeper immersion than VR
goggles. The TL9 version covers the entire head
with a helmet equipped with a pull-down visor and
comes with standard VR gloves; it provides the same
functions as improved VR Goggles at an early Tech
Level. The TL11 helmet exceeds what is possible with
mere goggles. Its helmet lining consists of hundreds
of external brain stimulation interfaces capable of
directly actuating the wearer’s brain. This allows for
the emulation of real sensory perception, including
full-body tactile sensation, smell and taste but it is still
a heavy item with limited battery life. The TL13 helmet
is not only much lighter but extends battery life from

eight hours to a full day. Helmets can be connected to
external power sources for longer uninterrupted use,
although this may limit mobility.
