                            At low Tech Levels, a First Aid kit consists of little more
                            than material for a splint and a few herbs and plants
                            reputed to have medicinal qualities – but it is better
                            than nothing. At higher Tech Levels, clean bandages,
                            safety pins, sutures with needle drivers and basic
                            pharmaceuticals (antibiotics, painkillers and possibly
                            alcohol to sterilise wounds) are added. First Aid performed
                            using the TL2 kit will inflict DM-2 to Medic checks, while at
                            TL5 the penalty drops to DM-1. More effective treatment
                            requires use of a field surgical kit or a medikit.
