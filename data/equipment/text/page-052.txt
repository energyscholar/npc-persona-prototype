CARDIOTRIGGER DETONATOR
The cardiotrigger detonator, or ‘dead man’s bomb’,
is not often an augmentation a Traveller will willingly
install. Typically used by terrorist organisations, rogue
governments and the occasional sociopath, this
augment links a single explosive device to the heart
rate of the Traveller. If the Traveller’s heart ever stops
beating, the bomb will detonate 2D seconds later. The
Tech Level and cost of the cardiotrigger detonator is
reliant upon the type of explosive used (see page 159),
adding +1 to the device’s Tech Level and multiplying its
cost by 10 times the cost of the explosive charge. The
cardiotrigger detonator is a Category 5 item in the rare
instances when legally sanctioned.

GENETIC AQUAMORPH ADAPTION
This genetic alteration transforms the
recipient into an amphibious being, able to
function both on land and under water indefinitely,
with some restrictions. Aquamorphs acquire modified
gills to allow indefinite breathing underwater to a safe
limit of 30 metres on worlds of standard atmospheric
pressure and gravity conditions. They can dive as
deep as 100 metres if they take proper precautions
against nitrogen narcosis. Modifications to body shape
include enlarged webbed hands and feet, and denser
body fat. Underwater, aquamorphs gain DM+2 to all                                                                         Augments
Recon checks (and suffer DM-2 on land) and gain
DM+2 for all checks related to swimming.

Survival on land is possible as long as aquamorphs
keep their skin moist and remain well hydrated – they
require twice the water intake of a baseline member of
their species – six litres per day for humans. Effective
STR is halved while on land. Both while underwater
and in microgravity, all aquamorphs are considered to
have Athletics (dexterity) skill of at least 0.
