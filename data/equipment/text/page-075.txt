              CHEMI-VIEW GOGGLES
              An advanced set of goggles which attach to a wrist-linked
              ‘sniffer’, chemi-view technology allows the user to set their
              viewer to a specific chemical compound, protein strand
              or elemental presence. The sniffer takes a sample and
              locks the goggles into the proper vision mode, causing
              the goggles to brightly any traces of that substance. This
              item is useful for finding drugs, bombs or alien species,
              but requires a reference sample to operate. The sniffer is
              powerful enough to be set for specific strands of DNA, if a
              tissue sample is made available.

              ELECTRONIC BINOCULARS
              Similar to optical binoculars, electronic binoculars also
              include a laser rangefinder and light intensification
              function that allows vision in all conditions of poor               Geiger Counter
              lighting except total darkness. Electronic binoculars
              do not allow the user to see through fog, smoke or
              thick foliage. At TL9 the binoculars include infrared
              and thermal imaging capabilities. From TL10 they
              incorporate an image-processing unit to help identify
              partially hidden objects.
