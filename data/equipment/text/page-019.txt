          Ablat: Ablat is a cheap alternative to reflec, fashioned
          from a material which will ablate (vaporise) when hit by
          laser fire or other energy weapons. The ablation of the
          material carries away the energy of the laser and protects
          the wearer. Continued fire against ablat degrades
          its effectiveness but the armour is cheap and easily
          replaceable. Ablat also has a minimal value against other
          forms of attack but it cannot be combined with any other
          types of armour. Each laser hit on ablat armour reduces
          its Protection score against lasers by one.

          plasma energy, this dense suit of polymer-alloy
          mixtures is well suited to blunt the impact of most
          blows. The advances made to these materials means
          directed plasma energy is far less likely to harm
          the wearer. While conduit-bleed can be worn over
