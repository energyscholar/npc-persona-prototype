ARCHAIC ARMOUR
Occasionally Travellers may encounter enemies
encased in primitive body armour or may be forced into
a position to purchase and use it themselves. While
inefficient, it can be effective against melee weapons
and some weak firearms.

Against ranged weapons of a higher Tech Level, all
armour in this section halves its Protection (rounding
up). Unless specifically stated, only one layer of archaic
armour can be worn at once.

 Breastplate: A metal breastplate covers the front           Breastplate                 Half-Plate
 and back of the torso, offering decent protection
 against hand weapons and archaic projectiles.

                                                                               Mail Hauberk
 Full Plate: A complete suit of armour comprising
 shaped and fitted metal plates, riveted and
 interlocked to cover the entire body. It includes
 gauntlets, heavy leather boots and a helmet. Plate
 is designed to distribute its weight over the body, so
 hampers movement less than might be expected.
 However, it is heavy and tiring to wear and the sheer
 mass of metal that has to be moved imposes DM-2
 on all checks involving physical activity, although
 there is no penalty to close combat attacks.


 Half-Plate: Favoured by heavy cavalry even after
 infantry have dispensed with meaningful armour
 themselves, half-plate consists of articulated plates
 backed by light mail and padding.


 Mail Hauberk: A knee-length coat of interlocking
 large or small metal rings set on a leather backing,
 a hauberk offers excellent protection against hand
 weapons and is used mainly by heavy infantry and
 cavalry. Scale mail (constructed with small plates
 rather than rings) offers similar protection and is a
 variation of the mail hauberk.

          Ablat: Ablat is a cheap alternative to reflec, fashioned
          from a material which will ablate (vaporise) when hit by
          laser fire or other energy weapons. The ablation of the
          material carries away the energy of the laser and protects
          the wearer. Continued fire against ablat degrades
          its effectiveness but the armour is cheap and easily
          replaceable. Ablat also has a minimal value against other
          forms of attack but it cannot be combined with any other
          types of armour. Each laser hit on ablat armour reduces
          its Protection score against lasers by one.

          plasma energy, this dense suit of polymer-alloy
          mixtures is well suited to blunt the impact of most

          the wearer. While conduit-bleed can be worn over

PROTECTIVE SUITS
Some armour comes as a complete suit and is worn with
a helmet and additional gear such as air tanks. Suits,
if sealed, offer total protection from gas and airborne
biological or chemical agents. These suits can be divided
into four types: civilian suits designed to protect the wearer
from vacuum or hazardous environments, unpowered
combat armour designed for protection against weaponry,
powered civilian or more often military armour designed for
heavy loads or severe conditions and battle dress, normally
only available to licensed military operatives.

Protective suits cannot be combined with other
armour, fitting tightly around the wearer and regulating
temperature. On the inside, these suits often have
connectors for medical sensors and waste disposal.
Additionally, the outer surfaces are covered with sensors,
equipment and radiative cooling coils. If Travellers desire
greater protection, they should purchase a modified
version or upgrade to a more protective suit.

ELECTRONICS SUITE
Unless otherwise stated, protective suits at TL8 and
above come equipped with the following electronics
suite appropriate to their Tech Level. All suites with a
scope are assumed to have a helmet heads-up display
(HUD) for all features of the suite. A protective suit built
and purchased at a higher Tech Level than standard
will contain an electronics suite suitable for its Tech
Level of manufacture but only if it is the most advanced
available version. For instance, a TL12 advanced vacc
suit manufactured at TL13 will contain include a TL13
suite and cost the standard Cr20000 but an improved
vacc suit (normally TL10 at Cr10000) manufactured
and purchased on a TL13 world would have at best a
TL11 electronics suite and cost Cr10000.

         Civilian suits provide armour protection but their
         main function is to protect a Traveller from a hostile
         environment. In most instances, these suits do not
         require special permits or certifications to purchase,
         although the explosive ordinance disposal suit occupies
         a grey area between civilian and military use.


          Emergency Hostile Environment Suit: A
          disposable emergency vacc suit is designed to protect
          the Traveller from corrosive, insidious and similarly
          hazardous atmospheres (and, of course, vacuum).
          The suit is good for six to eight hours in hazardous
          environments, after which there is a one in six (non-
          cumulative) chance it will fail every hour. Emergency
          suits are carried by starships to allow engineering crew
          to make emergency repairs under unusual conditions.
          The suit can be refurbished for Cr6000 but each
          refurbishment inflicts DM-1 to the chance of failure
          after the ‘safe’ time and reduces possible failure time
          by one hour. Once the failure chance has reached
          four in six, the suit is too degraded to be of use. An
          electronics suite is not included but there is an integral
          six-hour life support system.

POWERED SUITS
There is a class of armoured suit falling between
unpowered combat armour and the extremely                                                        Ceramic
advanced battle dress rigs; these are collectively                                               Powered Plate
called powered suits. Aided by servos, pneumatics and
counterweight mechanisms, powered suits enhance
the wearer’s strength at the cost of limited use between
refuelling or charging. Powered suits, if sealed, offer
total protection from gas and airborne biological agents
as well as ample radiation shielding.

While powered and active, the mass of a powered
suit does not count against the encumbrance of the
wearer and is effectively weightless. When a powered
suit is not charged or fuelled, the mass of the suit
does impair the wearer. Additionally, any STR bonus
the armour provides is lost and any DEX penalty the
armour imposes is doubled.

Unless otherwise stated, powered suits come equipped
with the electronics suite appropriate to their Tech
Level, as shown on page 27. Most are considered
Category 4 items; the only exceptions being the simple
exoskeleton and expensive, difficult to operate extreme
environment exploration suit.


Ceramic Powered Plate: An advanced version of
powered plate, made of advanced ceramic-metal hybrid
alloys, this armoured suit has a higher rate of protection
against lasers, flamethrowers and other heat or fire-
based attacks. Also, while the suit is running on its 85
hour power cell (Cr250 to replace), it adds STR+2 to the
Traveller but inflicts a DEX-2 penalty.

         differently. Battle dress enhances the strength and senses
         of individuals with variable feedback personal controls,
         servo-powered limbs and assorted electronic assistance.

         Basic suits do not come with any integrated weaponry
         and troops are usually armed with the best small arms
         and energy weapons available, carried in hand like regular
         troops, although powerful weaponry can also be integrated
         into the battle dress itself to ensure the operator is never
         without defence. It is also common for battle dress to be
         fitted with integral grav assist but this is not universal.

         All battle dress comes equipped with an electronics
         suite (see page 27) appropriate to its Tech Level
         and with the following additional standard equipment
         suitable to its Tech Level of manufacture:
         Personal Heads-up Display (P-HUD): Combined
         weapons/data HUD; each weapon requires separate
         HUD modules.
         Transceiver Encryption Module: Requires an
         equipped module on the target transceiver to establish
         secure communications links.
         Security/2 software: This program runs separate from
         the suit’s computer, protecting the suit from hacking.

         Additionally, battle dress is supremely customisable,
         either at point of manufacture or in the field, given
         sufficient technical expertise. Because of this, each
         suit of battle dress is listed as having a number of
         equipment Slots which can be filled with modifications,
         additions and weaponry. See page 44 for battle dress
         specific modifications.

         CHARACTERISTICS
         Operators wearing battle dress are treated as
         having enhanced characteristics (usually STR
         and DEX) for carrying equipment and modifiers

         in combat but not for taking damage. These
         enhancements are listed in the description.

         In addition, while powered and active, the mass of
         battle dress does not count against the encumbrance
         of the operator and is effectively weightless. By default,
         battle dress comes equipped with fuel cells sufficient for
         12 hours of full combat operation.

CARDIOTRIGGER DETONATOR
The cardiotrigger detonator, or ‘dead man’s bomb’,
is not often an augmentation a Traveller will willingly
install. Typically used by terrorist organisations, rogue
governments and the occasional sociopath, this
augment links a single explosive device to the heart
rate of the Traveller. If the Traveller’s heart ever stops
beating, the bomb will detonate 2D seconds later. The
Tech Level and cost of the cardiotrigger detonator is
reliant upon the type of explosive used (see page 159),
adding +1 to the device’s Tech Level and multiplying its
cost by 10 times the cost of the explosive charge. The
cardiotrigger detonator is a Category 5 item in the rare
instances when legally sanctioned.

GENETIC AQUAMORPH ADAPTION
This genetic alteration transforms the
recipient into an amphibious being, able to
function both on land and under water indefinitely,
with some restrictions. Aquamorphs acquire modified
gills to allow indefinite breathing underwater to a safe
limit of 30 metres on worlds of standard atmospheric
pressure and gravity conditions. They can dive as
deep as 100 metres if they take proper precautions
against nitrogen narcosis. Modifications to body shape
include enlarged webbed hands and feet, and denser
body fat. Underwater, aquamorphs gain DM+2 to all                                                                         Augments
Recon checks (and suffer DM-2 on land) and gain
DM+2 for all checks related to swimming.

Survival on land is possible as long as aquamorphs
keep their skin moist and remain well hydrated – they
require twice the water intake of a baseline member of
their species – six litres per day for humans. Effective
STR is halved while on land. Both while underwater
and in microgravity, all aquamorphs are considered to
have Athletics (dexterity) skill of at least 0.

A basic prosthetic is built with better grade alloys
and plastics. Attachment relies on standard and
safe medical procedures, although initial surgical
stabilisation of serious wounds still carries standard
risks. These prosthetic limbs and hands are shaped
like a real body part and allow somewhat competent
use after a rehabilitation period of 1D+2 weeks. This
prosthetic inflicts DM-1 to all DEX-based checks that
require its use. This augmentation is not affected by
electromagnetic attacks but is detectable as artificial.

An improved prosthetic uses robotic parts and
nerve-connected biofeedback that allow it to
function identically to a lost limb. After a 1D+2 week
rehabilitation period, the Traveller is able to perform
DEX-based checks with no penalty. This prosthetic
is affected by electromagnetic pulses and while still
detectable as artificial, it can be disguised by adding
Natural-looking and Invisitech options.

VENOM GLANDS
This bionic augment requires the insertion of toxic
salivary glands into the jawbone, making the saliva a
potent necrotic toxin. The Traveller inflicts an additional
D+3 points of damage whenever successfully biting a
living creature. Users are immune to their own venom
and bite victims with divergent biochemistries may not
necessarily be affected by these glands.

WAFER JACK
A wafer jack is a computer system implanted into the
base of the skull that contains a physical data socket
and a processor running an interface program. A
Traveller with a wafer jack can use Expert programs
for tasks relying on INT or EDU only. The main benefit
is that it is much smaller and more discrete than
a portable computer and the user can access the
Expert program by thought alone. A wafer jack has
a specialised Computer/2 for Expert programs only,
always running Intelligence Interface.

The wafer jack’s Intelligence Interface does not use                                                            Augments
any Bandwidth, so all available computer Bandwidth
may be used for running one or two Expert software
packages. Total storage capacity of physical data
wafers is indicated by the wafer jack’s total Bandwidth.
Swapping out software is done with physical media and

The advanced wafer jack has a specialised Computer/3
capable of simultaneously running one, two or three
Expert packages of total Bandwidth 3.

              CHEMI-VIEW GOGGLES
              An advanced set of goggles which attach to a wrist-linked
              ‘sniffer’, chemi-view technology allows the user to set their
              viewer to a specific chemical compound, protein strand
              or elemental presence. The sniffer takes a sample and
              locks the goggles into the proper vision mode, causing
              the goggles to brightly any traces of that substance. This
              item is useful for finding drugs, bombs or alien species,
              but requires a reference sample to operate. The sniffer is
              powerful enough to be set for specific strands of DNA, if a
              tissue sample is made available.

              Similar to optical binoculars, electronic binoculars also
              include a laser rangefinder and light intensification
              function that allows vision in all conditions of poor               Geiger Counter

              do not allow the user to see through fog, smoke or
              thick foliage. At TL9 the binoculars include infrared
              and thermal imaging capabilities. From TL10 they
              incorporate an image-processing unit to help identify
              partially hidden objects.

VR HELMET
A VR helmet allows for deeper immersion than VR
goggles. The TL9 version covers the entire head
with a helmet equipped with a pull-down visor and
comes with standard VR gloves; it provides the same
functions as improved VR Goggles at an early Tech
Level. The TL11 helmet exceeds what is possible with
mere goggles. Its helmet lining consists of hundreds
of external brain stimulation interfaces capable of
directly actuating the wearer’s brain. This allows for
the emulation of real sensory perception, including
full-body tactile sensation, smell and taste but it is still
a heavy item with limited battery life. The TL13 helmet
is not only much lighter but extends battery life from

                                ADDICTION AND WITHDRAWAL
                               At the Referee’s discretion, the use of various drugs may cause addiction and lead to dependence, cravings
                               and withdrawal. Besides recreational drugs, likely candidates for addiction include combat drug, meta-
                               performance enhancer, metabolic accelerator, nervous response dampener and stims. Even PSI drugs might
                               be addictive if that is an aspect the Referee wants to explore. These rules are suggested guidelines for the
                               Referee to consider if the negative aspects of drug use are to be part of a campaign.

                               Addiction has two main effects: cravings and withdrawal. Tolerance – the need to take more drugs to achieve
                               the same effect – can also factor in chronic use, although that will require additional recordkeeping. Actual
                               addiction rarely occurs after first use and some habitual users of a drug might avoid addiction altogether but
                               to simulate addiction, the Referee can require an END check to avoid it after a certain number of doses or
                               after a certain number within a constrained time period.

                               Withdrawal is a physical reaction to the absence of the drug to which the Traveller is addicted. This can be a
Medical and Care Supplies




                               debilitating condition, even fatal in some instances. After a period without any access to the drug, the addicted
                               Traveller in withdrawal must begin making increasingly difficult END checks, with negative Effects causing
                               temporary reduction to END and/or other characteristics. The number and severity of checks required for
                               withdrawal to complete and the time interval between checks is left to the discretion of the Referee but should
                               be consistent for the withdrawal effect for a particular drug, at least across a particular species.

                               Cravings often occur after withdrawal but more often begin long before withdrawal becomes an issue.
                               Cravings are controlled by continued use of the drug. Failure to acquire an adequate supply will tend to result
                               in increasingly erratic behaviour. The optional Fatigue rules presented in the Naval Campaign Sourcebook
                               (page 58) and the Deepnight Revelation Referee Handbook (page 41) can be impacted by this craving, with
                               increasingly negative DMs to avoid Fatigue as time passes. Or the Referee may simply require DM-1 for all
                               checks for every day or week the Traveller goes without the drug. Cravings will cease when the drug is taken
                               again, resetting the clock for both cravings and withdrawal. Cravings will usually, but not necessarily, subside
                               after a longer period of time (months, possibly years) after the last dose was taken.

                RADIATION SUIT
                An NBC suit will protect the Traveller against
                contamination from irradiated particles such as
                dust but offers little or no protection against direct
                radiation such as solar flares or a reactor breach. A
                vacc suit will offer some protection but for areas of
                hard radiation a dedicated radiation suit is required,
                reducing exposure by 100 rads. Radiation suits
                become more protective at higher Tech Levels, adding
                10 rads of protection for each TL above 6.

                Radiation suits do not protect against vacuum or
                underwater environments but include the capabilities of an
                environment suit (see page 29) and can accommodate life
                support masks, oxygen tanks and rebreathers.

ARCTIC AND COLD ENVIRONMENTS
Travellers, at least humans, cannot survive long in cold
environments. As noted on page 82 in the Traveller               Heatsuit
Core Rulebook, lack of protection in the cold will
eventually cause damage to unprotected Travellers.

COLD WEATHER CLOTHING
A set of heavy outer garments designed to protect
the wearer from extremely cold temperatures. Natural
materials are used at lower Tech Levels. Higher-tech
clothing is less bulky and protects the wearer better.
The clothing reduces the damage from arctic conditions
to 1D every four hours (see page 82 of the Traveller
Core Rulebook) and the time between damage rolls
increases by two hours per TL above 0. The clothing
is quite clumsy at low Tech Levels, inflicting a DEX-1
penalty but usability improves as it advances.

HEATSUIT
A coverall-like garment incorporating battery-powered
heater coils. The heatsuit eliminates the ill effects of
temperatures down to -60ºC. It is not damaged by
immersion in water but will not function while the wearer
is immersed. The battery lasts 12 hours and can be
recharged or replaced. The suit can also be directly
powered from the output socket of a small power source.

An oval-shaped bowl sitting atop a wide-footed tripod
nearly a metre tall when extended, the hydro-collector
uses tiny electromagnetic pulses to draw moisture out of
the air and collect it as drinkable water. One eight-hour
collection session will provide an amount of drinking water
depending on the average local atmospheric humidity. In
arid areas this will produce three litres or enough water for
one person-day. In temperate areas, nine litres. In moist
or humid areas, 15 litres. The device is solar powered and
recharges while it is collecting, in most cases.

                sustenance. A human Traveller in the field will require
                at least three litres of water and two units of caloric-
                dense (often dehydrated) sustenance per day. Heavy
                exertion, extreme heat or cold and other factors may
                increase these requirements by a factor of two or more.

                A basic carrying bag with shoulder straps and external

                PURIFICATION TABLETS
                These small, chalky white tablets are stored in waxed
                paper envelopes to keep them from being exposed
                to airborne humidity. When dropped in a container of
                water (one tablet per four litres) there is a powerful
                effervescent reaction. A foam forms and traps all
                natural impurities before rising to the top of the water
                to be poured or scraped off. While these tablets will
                not neutralise poison or radiation, they are essential to
                eliminate natural bacteria and pollutants. The advanced
                versions will filter any liquid that is at least 80% water
                (one tablet needed for every 10 litres) and all radiation,
                poison, additives or the intoxicating alcohol in a liquid
                will be instantly nullified and sublimated as pops of
                bubbles on the surface.

A fission microreactor will not scale smaller than
Medium size but will provide power with little need for
maintenance for up to 25 years. These reactors have
severely restricted availability on most worlds, as their
components are extremely hazardous, although their
fuel is not nearly enriched enough to build a nuclear
bomb. After 20 + 1D years, these reactors will need
maintenance and refuelling, requiring 1D weeks and
50% of their initial cost in parts and fuel.

off water electrolysed into hydrogen and expels
oxygen as a waste gas. It does not require or support
external fuel tanks, as its fuel supply is constantly
run through a series of cooling and generating tubes
to provide fusion at relatively low temperatures. The
water doubles as radiation shielding and accounts
for half the mass of the reactor. Oxygen is the only
waste product, expelled gradually over the generator’s
period of operation. Deuterium-enriched water,
available for Cr500 per recharge, will increase the
generator’s operating duration by a factor of 10 before
it requires refuelling and maintenance.

                                        A belt-carried pack, this emergency kit is designed
                                        to allow a vacc suited user to save themselves or

                                        makes a search more likely to find them. The kit
                                        contains a radio beacon/repeater, a handheld strobe

           UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL WEAPONS
           All weapons described in this section require the Melee
           (unarmed) skill to use effectively. A human striking with
           bare fists or feet inflicts 1D with a melee attack.

           BRASS KNUCKLES
           A heavy knuckleduster (which may or may not be made
           of actual brass), brass knuckles add inertia to a punch,
           as well as protecting the fist. Heavy boots or specially
           modified shoes with hard striking surfaces can also
           function in the same way.                                            Handspikes


           CLAW GLOVE
           A heavy glove with retractable claws, this item was
           developed to counter augmented Aslan dewclaws
           and to support lethal pit-fighting in seedier human and
           Vargr communities, although versions are available
           for nearly any species with hands. Most worlds ban
           such activities – and the gloves, which are considered
           personal concealable weapons.

           A piece of cord or wire, sometimes with handles to
           make it easier to apply force. A garrotte can only be
           used upon an opponent who has been successfully
           grappled (see the Traveller Core Rulebook, page 78).
           If a successful grapple leads to an enemy suffering
           damage, the garrotte will inflict 2D damage, plus the
           Effect of the opposed Melee check. Every consecutive
           round in which a garrotte is successfully used will add
           an additional 1D to the damage caused.                          Monofilament

           HANDSPIKES
           Essentially a heavy knuckleduster with spikes that
           penetrate rather than just relying on simple impact,
           handspikes are intimidating and leave a very nasty

Weaponry




           KNUCKLEBLASTERS
           A truly vicious weapon, the knuckleblasters take the
           form of a reinforced glove with heavily padded fingers
           that incorporate a row of sockets across the back of
           the hand. These sockets are loaded individually with
           four shotgun shells which detonate when the wielder’s
           fist comes into hard contact with a target, causing a
           devastating amount of damage. After a successful
           attack, the knuckleblasters must be reloaded, a process
           requiring two Significant Actions.

           SHIELDS
           A Traveller using a standard shield increases their
           effective Melee skill by +1 when parrying. A Traveller
           with no Melee skill counts as having Melee 0 when
           using a shield to parry. If used as a weapon instead,
           they require the Melee (bludgeon) skill.

           BOARDING SHIELD
           Used by shipboard security personnel and law
           enforcement special-response teams, the boarding
           shield is a large movable obstacle. It cannot be used
           to parry but instead provides the wielder with cover
           (Protection +8, see page 77 of the Traveller Core
           Rulebook for the effects of cover). Most boarding
           shields have a vision slit or firing port in the front
           surface. A boarding shield completely protects anyone
           hiding behind it and is large enough for two people
           to benefit from it simultaneously or to move it forward                       Buckler
           while remaining covered.

           BUCKLER
           A small wood and metal shield held in the hand and
                                                                                             Expandable Shield
           used to parry incoming blows. A buckler requires skill
           to use effectively. It acts as a shield but does not
           grant an effective Melee 0 if the wielder has no skill
           in Melee to begin with.

           EXPANDABLE SHIELD
           An expandable shield deploys from a bracer on the
           wearer’s forearm. Using morphable materials, it
           expands on voice or electronic command to become
           any size from a buckler to a boarding shield, providing
           Protection +8 as cover but it is lightweight enough to
           not be considered bulky in that role.

           GRAVITIC SHIELD
           Worn as an armband or bracer, when activated the

           GAUSS PISTOL
           Gauss pistols use electromagnetic coils to accelerate
           metallic darts to hypersonic speeds. Gauss weapons
           are lightweight, efficient and deadly.                           Heavy Revolver

           HEAVY REVOLVER
           A more robust and solidly built version of the standard
           revolver, a heavy revolver fires a long (Magnum) 10mm
           or even 12mm cartridge.

           MAGRAIL PISTOL
           Using similar technology to gauss weapons, magrail
           pistols throw ovoid projectiles (sometimes erroneously           Magrail Pistol
           called discs or shuriken) which hit hard at short ranges
           but lack penetrative power.

           REVOLVER
           A conventional six-shooter handgun.

           SHOT PISTOL
           This is a single shot, break-open smoothbore                     Revolver
           handgun designed to fire non-standard low-powered
           14mm cartridges, intended to deal with snakes and
           similar vermin in the wilderness. It is virtually useless
           beyond a few metres.

           SNUB PISTOL
           These lightweight, low-recoil weapons fire rocket-

           spacecraft and in zero gravity.

           UNIVERSAL AUTOPISTOL
           This is a small-calibre semi-automatic handgun
           designed to be used by a variety of alien hands and
           appendages, enabling armed forces to issue a standard
           sidearm to non-human personnel. The weapon is
           also known as a staple gun because of its shape and
           modest effectiveness.

           and the stock removed. It has a very short range but
           the wide spread of shot doubles the attack roll bonus
           at short range (DM+2). A sawed-off shotgun is treated
           as a light assault weapon and prohibited at Law Level
           4 and above, although conversion from a standard
           shotgun requires only a saw that will cut through metal.

           Shotguns are smoothbore weapons that typically fire
           ammunition containing multiple small pellets. They are
           most effective at short range. A shotgun using pellet
           ammunition ignores Dodge dice modifiers but armour

           This is a high-tech, high-calibre rifle designed for
           maximum accuracy and penetration. With its integrated
           silencer and magnification scope, long-distance targets
           can be killed quietly and efficiently.

           SNUB CARBINE
           The carbine version of the snub pistol uses the same
           receiver with a longer barrel and a folding stock.
           Operation is still semi-automatic and, overall, the

           MATTER DISINTEGRATOR
           This highly advanced weapon causes atoms to release
           particles in rapid succession, effectively disintegrating
           its target. At TL19, the matter disintegrator integrates

           PEPPER SPRAY
           Not technically an energy weapon but a dispenser for a
           chemical irritant, pepper spray, also referred to as bear
           spray or mace, fires a stream of chemical irritant to deter
           attack. Of limited range and only useful against targets
           with an exposed face (no helmet or mask), pepper spray                 Laser Pistol
           is a defensive weapon that is sometimes used by law
           enforcement to disperse crowds and as protection on
           worlds that prohibit offensive ranged weapons.

           A wielder of a pepper spray dispenser can substitute an
           Average (8+) DEX check to attack if they do not have
           the Gun Combat skill. Any living target struck with the

           PERSONAL DEFENCE LASER
           A lightweight laser weapon fed by one-use chemical
           cartridges rather than an external power pack, the
           personal defence laser (PDL) uses a 25-round
           magazine inserted in the handgrip. It is capable of
           fully-automatic fire and is used as a sidearm by some
           military officers. It is somewhat bulkier than a laser                                            Stunners

                                 when used but they require a separate skill level in the
                                 specific monofilament weapon to avoid that weapon

                                 This is a throwing weapon made from two or three
                                 weights fastened together by a cord. It is used to bring
                                 down an enemy rather than hurt them. A person hit by a
Short Bow                        bolas does not sustain any damage. Instead, they must
                                 make a Melee (unarmed) check opposed by the Athletics
                                 (dexterity) check of the attacker, as if being grappled. If
                                 failed, the defender is immobilised and falls prone. The
                                 defender can free themself by performing a successful
                                 Routine (6+) DEX check as a Significant Action.


                  Long Bow       BOOMERANG
                                 The boomerang is a shaped piece of wood designed
                                 to be thrown and deliver damage to a target. Most
                                 boomerangs used for hunting do not return to the
                                 thrower but a returning boomerang can be purchased
                                 for Cr10. It inflicts DM-2 on attack rolls but if it misses
                                 a target it will return to the thrower in the next combat
                                 round. It can be caught with a successful Athletics
  Crossbow                       (dexterity) check. The thrower will take damage equal
                                 to the Effect if it is negative and drop the boomerang.

                                 MONOFILAMENT BOLAS
                                 Unlike the primitive bolas, this weapon does not
                                 entangle an enemy but slices through any target with
                                 its monofilament cords. The bolas will not immobilise a
                                 target on a successful attack.

                                 MONOFILAMENT NET
                                 Unlike a standard net, this weapon is designed to slice
                                 its victim in multiple locations. A person attacked by
                                 a net must make a Melee (unarmed) check opposed                Weaponry
                                 by the Athletics (dexterity) check of the attacker, as
                                 if being grappled. If this check is failed, the defender
                                 suffers damage dice equal to the Effect of the failure.
                                 On subsequent rounds, the entrapped person can
                                 either remain immobilised, taking no further damage, or
                                 choose to try to escape by making a successful Difficult
   Repeating Crossbow            (10+) DEX check; failure causes additional damage
                                 dice equal to the negative Effect.

           This is a large net, usually with weights fastened
           to its extremities. It is thrown over a target with the
           intention of entangling them. A person hit by a net

           A standard artillery piece on many worlds, this gun
           is usually mounted on a vehicle. Some versions can
           handle small nuclear warheads but this is not usual.
           This weapon is theoretically capable of firing over open

           LIGHT HOWITZER
           A short-barrelled artillery piece crewed by up to six
           personnel and usually moved by animal power or
           towed by a vehicle, the light howitzer can deliver shells
           towards far off targets. It can also fire over open sights
           but there are far better weapons for this role.

                                                                                                   Support Mortar
           LIGHT GUN
           A long-barrelled artillery piece, this gun has a higher muzzle
           velocity than the equivalent howitzer and can hit targets
           further away. It is also more capable in the direct fire role.


           MASS DRIVER
           An advanced tube-based artillery piece using
           electromagnetic acceleration to hurl its payload, a mass
           driver will normally be mounted on a vehicle. It requires
           a crew of at least eight, including power technicians as
           well as gunners and is effective in the direct-fire role.

           SIEGE GUN
           An updated version of the largest artillery piece ever
           built on old Terra, this 800mm siege gun must be
           moved in parts and assembled in its firing position,                                   Seige Gun
           making it unwieldy and prone to counter-battery fire
           by lesser, but more practical, pieces. Its awesome
           warhead can be delivered to a target many kilometres
           away and a direct hit from its five ton shell would flatten
           a tank, or even a maritime vessel, with ease – before
           detonating. It is extremely slow to reload, requiring 1D
           hours between firing shells.

           SUPPORT MORTAR                                                                    Mass Driver
           A heavy mortar mounted on a wheeled carriage rather
           than being carried by infantry, the support mortar flings a
           bomb in the 120mm range over a respectable distance.

           AEROSPACE DEFENCE LASER
           A powerful laser weapon designed for emplaced or
           mobile aerospace defence, it consumes immense power
           but delivers impressive damage. It is intended primarily
           to engage missiles and small craft but can attack                               Aerospace Defence Laser
           starships, aircraft and grav vehicles equally well.


           AUTOCANNON
           Autocannons are rapid-fire belt-fed weapons, with
           shells ranging from 20–65mm, capable of providing
           tactical support against infantry, light vehicles and
           aircraft. Autocannons are generally used to protect
           bunkers or mounted on light armoured vehicles, aircraft
           or aboard maritime vessels. Autocannons may use                                                Autocannon
           the variant ammunition types found in the Specialised
           Ammunition chapter.

           BLACK POWDER CANNON
           This is a simple smoothbore black-powder cannon                                               Black Powder
           capable of delivering shot out to a kilometre or so without                                   Cannon
           any real degree of accuracy. Roundshot is the most
           commonly used ammunition, although canister shot is
           also popular. The black powder cannon typically requires
           a crew of six or so plus beasts of burden to move it. It
           may use canister rounds but not other variant types
           listed in the Specialised Ammunition chapter.

           CANNON
           A large calibre gun used to arm the heavy tanks and
           armoured vehicles of mid-Tech Level armies. Cannons
           may use the variant ammunition types found in the
           Specialised Ammunition chapter.
                                                                          Cannon
           FIELD GUN
           A rifled muzzle-loading cannon mounted on a
           horse-drawn carriage and requiring a crew of six or
           more, the field gun is more accurate at range than
           a smoothbore cannon. Field guns may use canister                                               Field Gun
           rounds but not other variants listed in the Specialised

           FUSION GUN
           One of the most powerful ground-based weapons
           ever made, the fusion gun can blast through just
           about any material.




                                                                                                           Fusion Gun

GATLING LASER
A relatively low-powered, vehicle-mounted laser weapon,
the gatling laser uses several cryogenically cooled
barrels fired in succession to deliver a hail of fire. The
gatling laser is often used as an air-defence weapon.

                                                                                 Gatling Laser
GAUSS CANNON
This weapon uses advanced electromagnetic (‘gauss’)
propulsion to accelerate a metal dart to tremendous
speed. The projectile is a lump of dense metal which
damages the target using kinetic energy and the gauss
cannon is capable of firing them rapidly. The gauss
cannon may use the variant ammunition types found in
the Specialised Ammunition chapter.

HEAVY MACHINEGUN                                             Gauss Cannon
Designed to be mounted upon a vehicle or tripod, the
heavy machinegun has proven effective against light
vehicles and aircraft but is primarily intended to mow
down advancing infantry. The heavy machinegun may
use the rifle variant ammunition types found in the
Specialised Ammunition chapter.
                                                                            Heavy Machinegun
HYPERVELOCITY CANNON
The hypervelocity cannon uses electromagnetic
propulsion, similar to a gauss weapon and is typically
mounted in emplacements or very large vehicles.
Despite its range, it can be used against targets in low
orbit if it can be elevated far enough. This extended
range (100 kilometres) is only useful in direct fire at
airborne or orbital targets as this weapon cannot ‘lob’
its projectiles like a howitzer. The hypervelocity cannon
may use the variant ammunition types found in the
Specialised Ammunition chapter.                                Hypervelocity Cannon

LASER CANNON
A single barrel laser main gun for a vehicle, the laser
cannon is the first truly effective vehicle energy weapon.

MESON ACCELERATOR
A battlefield-grade meson accelerator requires a
huge power supply and can only be mounted in
                                                                                                         Weaponry
emplacements or the very largest of vehicles. It is
similar in operation to starship-grade meson guns                                        Laser Cannon
in that the particles it accelerates do not interact
with matter until they decay, allowing the weapon to
effectively shoot through any obstruction so long as the
target’s location is known. Meson accelerators ignore
all Armour and radiation shielding.



                                                                            Meson Accelerator

                                                                          T     R     A       V    E      L       L     E   R




           ORBITAL DEFENCE CANNON
           An extremely large hypervelocity cannon, this weapon
           can engage targets on the ground but, if elevated, can
           attack its preferred targets, low-orbiting spacecraft. If it
           does so, it increases its range to 1,000 kilometres.

           PLASMA GUN
           A heavy plasma gun designed for mounting on vehicles,              Orbital Defence Cannon
           this weapon is generally fitted to advanced grav vehicles
           and some aircraft. However, it is intended more as a
           support weapon than main anti-vehicle armament.

           RAIL GUN
           This is a powerful vehicle-mounted cannon that uses
           electromagnetic propulsion to fling a solid projectile in a
           flat trajectory that damages the target using kinetic energy.
           Time of flight to the target is less than conventional guns,
           making compensation for movement easier.
                                                                                 Plasma Gun
           ROTARY AUTOCANNON
           Although relatively small calibre, this autocannon
           utilises rotating barrels, enabling it to sustain a hideous
           rate of fire. It is equally effective against infantry and
           light vehicles and, with armour-piercing ammunition, it
           can even be useful against tanks. A rotary autocannon
           may use the variant ammunition types found in the
           Specialised Ammunition chapter.

           VRF GAUSS GUN
           The very rapid-firing (VRF) gauss gun is a support                                          Rail Gun
           weapon that uses electromagnetic technology to deliver
           withering bursts of fire. Often used as an anti-personnel
           weapon on vehicles, consumption of ammunition is
           prodigious and large hoppers are used to ensure
           adequate supply in combat. The VRF gauss gun may
           use the rifle variant ammunition types found in the
           Specialised Ammunition chapter.

           VRF MACHINEGUN
Weaponry




           This weapon is constructed from six machinegun
           barrels which rotate through firing positions to maintain          VRF Gauss Cannon
           a very high rate of fire without adverse heating. The
           VRF machinegun may use the rifle variant ammunition
           types found in the Specialised Ammunition chapter.

      ARMOUR PIERCING
      These rounds are pointed projectiles of dense or very
      hard material designed to punch through armour. AP
      ammunition provides a weapon with an AP trait equal to
      the number of damage dice it rolls. If the weapon already
      has the AP trait, this is added to the final AP score.
