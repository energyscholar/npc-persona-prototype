      "original_response": "*adjusts glasses and pulls out a thick manila folder marked 'DETACHED DUTY AGREEMENTS - STANDARD TERMS'*\n\nWell, that depends on how things go during your year. Per standard regulations, you'll have a one-year detached duty agreement with the usual renewal options.\n\n*flips through several pages*\n\nIf you maintain the ship properly - pass your quarterly inspections, file your reports on time, keep her spaceworthy - you can renew for additional years. Most detached duty crews keep their ships for quite a while. Some of our people have been out there for decades.\n\nOf course, if you decide the scout life isn't for you, or if there are... performance issues... the Service takes the ship back. She'd go to another crew or back into active service, depending on her condition.\n\n*closes the folder with a slight smile*\n\nThe previous crew? They forfeited their agreement when they decided to start selling off her components. That's why you're here instead of them. But assuming you don't try anything that creative, Highndry should be yours for as long as you want her and treat her right.\n\nStandard procedure is to review the agreement terms after the first year. Most crews who make it that far tend to stick around - it's good duty if you don't mind the independence and occasional excitement.\n\nAny other questions about the long-term arrangements?",

      "original_response": "*The voice of chronicle settles into explanation, with the weight of bureaucratic tradition behind it*\n\nDetached duty - a peculiar arrangement within the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service. Rather than assign scouts to fixed postings or regular patrol routes, the IISS occasionally approves independent operations. Think of it as a form of privateer license, but for exploration rather than warfare.\n\nThe travellers have been granted a one-year renewable lease on the scout/courier *Highndry* - not ownership, mind you, but operational control. The ship remains IISS property, but they are free to use her as they see fit: trading, exploring, courier work, whatever ventures call to them. The lease can be renewed annually, assuming they maintain the vessel and don't bring disgrace upon the Service.\n\nIt's an unusual opportunity - most scouts serve in structured hierarchies, following orders and filing reports. Detached duty offers freedom... at the price of self-reliance. No regular supply drops, no backup fleet, no steady pay. Just a ship, a license to operate, and whatever opportunities the galaxy provides.\n\nOf course, nothing comes without conditions. Before they can claim the *Highndry*, there's the small matter of completing the task that stranded her previous crew on Walston in the first place...\n\n*A pause, heavy with implication*\n\nThe Scout Service does not abandon its vessels lightly.",

      "original_response": "*Adjusts spectacles, clears throat with a scholarly tone*\n\nDetached duty is essentially a specialized Scout Service lease agreement. In this case, the Type S Scout/Courier Highndry is being provisionally assigned to your team for one year, renewable based on performance. Think of it like a professional probation - you're not owners, but authorized operators.\n\nThe IISS - Imperial Interstellar Scout Service - retains ultimate ownership of the vessel. Your team receives operational control, but must meet specific conditions. Here on Walston, that means completing the abandoned Mount Salbarii volcano survey to secure your lease. The initial term is one year, with potential renewal if you demonstrate competence and fulfill the assigned mission.\n\nMinister Greener is your gatekeeper. Complete the survey, earn the Cr3000 bonus, and the ship becomes your operational platform. Fail, and the Highndry returns to direct Scout Service control. It's a performance-based arrangement that requires skill, dedication, and successful mission completion.\n\n*Leans forward, a glint of academic enthusiasm in my eyes*\n\nAny further questions about the nuances of detached duty?",

Scattered rocky outcroppings provide occasional shelter, though they also suggest the ongoing geological instability of the region. The ground tends to be gravelly, with frequent loose stone that makes vehicle travel difficult and hiking precarious.\n\nTemperature drops noticeably as elevation increases, and wind patterns become more erratic. Our preliminary survey notes suggest these slopes experience significant temperature variations between day and night, creating challenging environmental conditions.\n\n*Pauses, adds with a hint of professional caution*\n\nI should note that these Lower Slopes weren't just a geographical feature for the previous scout team - they were part of a critical survey mission.

One thousand one hundred meters above sea level - a threshold where the mountain transforms from mere landscape to living challenge.

The terrain shifts subtly: rocky slopes replace gentler approaches, vegetation becomes sparse, wind more persistent.\n\nPhysiologically, this zone demands respect. Your body will begin to notice - heartrate increases, respiration becomes more labored. A seasoned traveler moves deliberately, understanding that speed is the enemy of acclimatization. Push too quickly, and altitude sickness can ambush even experienced mountaineers. \n\nThe environment is not hostile, but neither is it forgiving. Temperatures fluctuate rapidly. A midday warmth can dissolve into sharp evening chill within hours. Technical mountain gear becomes less a luxury and more a necessity. Layers. Windbreakers. Proper footwear.\n\nMount Salbarii's Middle Ascent is particularly notable - volcanic terrain means unstable ground, potential gas vents, occasional unexpected thermal zones.

        "adventure_overview": "High and Dry is the story of travellers approved for Scout Service detached duty - a one-year renewable lease on the scout/courier Highndry, stranded on the backwater world of Walston. The ship belongs to the IISS; they will operate it independently under lease terms. To claim it, they must complete a job the previous crew abandoned: surveying Mount Salbarii volcano. What begins as a simple task becomes a race against geological disaster.",
        "act_one_journey": "The adventure begins at Flammarion, where the travellers receive Scout Service approval for detached duty - a Type S Scout/Courier awaits them on distant Walston under a one-year renewable lease. They book passage aboard the far trader Autumn Gold under Captain Michelle Corelli. A week in jump brings them to the uninhabited waypoint 567-908, then another week to Walston itself. The journey is uneventful but builds anticipation.",
        "act_two_walston": "Walston is a small world with thin atmosphere and a hereditary dictatorship. The starport is modest, the startown small but functional. The locals wear traditional kilts and hold traditional views - including a quiet racism toward Vargr, who serve but do not lead. Minister Alan Greener controls access to the Highndry: complete the volcano survey, and the ship is theirs. Cr3000 sweetens the deal. The customs officer and the bartender at the Dusty Airlock can fill in details about the previous crew - a group of troublemakers who botched the job and fled.",
        "act_three_ship": "The Highndry lies 120 kilometers from the capital, in the mountains near Mount Salbarii. The journey there crosses varied terrain. Near the ship, travellers may encounter Tensher's Wolf - a large predator left behind by the previous crew, now feral and hungry but potentially tameable. The ship itself is disabled but recoverable. Circuit blocks need replacing, systems need calibration, but she can fly again.",
        "act_four_crisis": "The volcano was never dormant - it was building pressure. As the travellers complete their survey, Mount Salbarii erupts. What follows is a race against time: mapping lava flows, coordinating with Dictator Masterton's emergency response, evacuating the coastal town of Barvinn. Choices must be made - eleven refugees at Barvinn, or the Vargr chauffeur and her parents in a downed limo. Not everyone can be saved. The resolution depends on player choices, but the Highndry proves her worth in the crisis.",
        "themes": "High and Dry explores several themes: the moral complexity of stable but unjust societies (Walston's treatment of Vargr), the value of competence under pressure, the weight of impossible choices in crisis, and the bond between travellers and their ship. It is a story about earning something through action rather than just claiming it.",
        "key_npcs": "Minister Alan Greener is the gatekeeper - fair but firm, he offers a deal and expects it honored. Dictator Masterton appears only in crisis, decisive and practical. The customs officer and bartender hold pieces of the puzzle about the previous crew. Captain Corelli provides transport. The unnamed Vargr chauffeur becomes unexpectedly heroic.",
        "locations": "Flammarion (start), 567-908 (waypoint), Walston Starport, Startown (the Dusty Airlock bar), Government Building (Greener's office), the mountain route, the Highndry crash site, Mount Salbarii, the coastal town of Barvinn, Salbarii command post.",

Walston maintains strict weapons control. Any firearms, blades over 10cm, or energy weapons must be stored at the starport safebox (Cr10/week) and collected upon departure. Travellers must choose: declare weapons and pay storage, attempt to smuggle (risking serious consequences at TL8 detection), or proceed unarmed. The customs officer is professional and thorough but not hostile.",
        "walston_law_level": "Walston is Law Level 8 - high law. Weapons are prohibited outside the home. Controlled blades, firearms, and energy weapons must be declared at customs and stored at the starport. This is strictly enforced.

From 1000 meters to the crater lip at 1400 meters, this segment transforms from challenging terrain to a near-vertical challenge that demands absolute technical precision.\n\nImagine a rock face so steep that each meter requires calculated movement - hands gripping volcanic stone that can crumble without warning, feet seeking purchase on surfaces that resist human ambition. The thin atmosphere at this altitude means every breath is a negotiation, every movement deliberate. Your climbing equipment isn't just gear; it's your lifeline.\n\nGeological instability is your constant companion. This isn't just a mountain, but a volcanic system building toward eruption. Every handhold might be your last, every anchor point a potential betrayal. The survey team doesn't simply climb - they dance with a geological threat that could transform from static rock to molten danger in moments.\n\n*A pause, then quietly* Not everyone who begins this ascent will complete it. The mountain makes no promises. Your skill, your preparation, your teamwork - these are your only guarantees.\n\n*The narrative voice carries a blend of clinical assessment and profound respect for the mountain's challenge*\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the Final Ascent?",

However, the thin atmosphere means each step requires more effort than a traveller might be accustomed to on more oxygen-rich worlds.\n\nVegetation here is predominantly low-profile: hardy, wind-resistant plants adapted to minimal precipitation. Ground cover is sparse but resilient - expect greyish-green tufts of grass-analog and occasional rocky outcroppings that provide momentary shelter.\n\nWater sources are minimal.

      "original_response": "*Adjusts voice, a measured tone of professional assessment*\n\nThe Highndry? She's disabled, but not destroyed. Her primary issues are circuit block failures across several key systems. We'll need systematic recalibration and replacement parts. The good news is she's fundamentally sound - a scout ship built to endure. Her circuit problems suggest electrical disruption, possibly from the rough landing near Mount Salbarii. \n\nThe previous crew's hasty departure left her wounded but not fatal. She'll need careful diagnostics, targeted repairs. Circuit blocks are relatively straightforward replacements for a competent team. Think of her like a thoroughbred horse - temporarily lame, but with proper care, she'll run again.\n\n*A subtle undertone of affection enters the narrative voice*\n\nAnd she WILL run again. The Highndry isn't just a ship; she's our ticket to completing this mission and claiming our independent Scout Service lease. A few circuit blocks aren't stopping her - or us.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on the specific systems that need attention?",

What begins as a simple task becomes a race against geological disaster.",
        "act_one_journey": "The adventure begins at Flammarion, where the travellers receive Scout Service approval for detached duty - a Type S Scout/Courier awaits them on distant Walston under a one-year renewable lease. They book passage aboard the far trader Autumn Gold under Captain Michelle Corelli. A week in jump brings them to the uninhabited waypoint 567-908, then another week to Walston itself. The journey is uneventful but builds anticipation.",
        "act_two_walston": "Walston is a small world with thin atmosphere and a hereditary dictatorship. The starport is modest, the startown small but functional. The locals wear traditional kilts and hold traditional views - including a quiet racism toward Vargr, who serve but do not lead. Minister Alan Greener controls access to the Highndry: complete the volcano survey, and the ship is theirs. Cr3000 sweetens the deal. The customs officer and the bartender at the Dusty Airlock can fill in details about the previous crew - a group of troublemakers who botched the job and fled.",
        "act_three_ship": "The Highndry lies 120 kilometers from the capital, in the mountains near Mount Salbarii. The journey there crosses varied terrain. Near the ship, travellers may encounter Tensher's Wolf - a large predator left behind by the previous crew, now feral and hungry but potentially tameable. The ship itself is disabled but recoverable. Circuit blocks need replacing, systems need calibration, but she can fly again.",
        "act_four_crisis": "The volcano was never dormant - it was building pressure. As the travellers complete their survey, Mount Salbarii erupts. What follows is a race against time: mapping lava flows, coordinating with Dictator Masterton's emergency response, evacuating the coastal town of Barvinn. Choices must be made - eleven refugees at Barvinn, or the Vargr chauffeur and her parents in a downed limo. Not everyone can be saved. The resolution depends on player choices, but the Highndry proves her worth in the crisis.",
        "themes": "High and Dry explores several themes: the moral complexity of stable but unjust societies (Walston's treatment of Vargr), the value of competence under pressure, the weight of impossible choices in crisis, and the bond between travellers and their ship.

Experienced mountaineers might opt for a direct climb to save time, but the terrain demands careful consideration - each step is a calculated risk against the mountain's unforgiving gradient. The path here is not merely a route, but a conversation with the landscape itself, where strategic detours can mean the difference between progress and peril.",

Her fundamental integrity remains uncompromised, a silent narrative of survival etched into every centimeter of her hull.",

The Vargr are accepted but face a 'glass ceiling' - they can work in most jobs but rarely hold positions of authority. This social structure is stable but quietly unjust. Travellers may notice that service staff are predominantly Vargr while officials are human.",
        "altitude": "At 1100m, travelers enter the Middle Ascent zone where altitude begins to reveal its subtle yet unmistakable challenges. The ascent's pace demands respect; push too quickly and sickness can ambush even seasoned mountain travelers, your body struggling against the thinning air and increasing environmental demands. Here, the mountain does not simply offer a route, but presents a living challenge that tests both physical endurance and adaptive skill.",
        "ascent": "The Final Ascent stands as the most challenging segment of the Mount Salbarii expedition, a near-vertical climb spanning from 1000m to the crater lip at 1400m. This last stretch is a punishing, almost sheer rock face that demands absolute concentration and technical climbing skill, where each meter gained brings the survey team closer to both their scientific objective and potential geological peril.",
        "lowerslopes": "Between 500 and 900m, the mountain's Lower Slopes become dramatically steep, forcing travelers to navigate intricate paths that wind around imposing rock faces. Experienced mountaineers might opt for a direct climb to save time, but the terrain demands careful consideration - each step is a calculated risk against the mountain's unforgiving gradient. The path here is not merely a route, but a conversation with the landscape itself, where strategic detours can mean the difference between progress and peril.",
        "damage": "The High and Dry bears the subtle marks of her volcanic environment - scoring along her exterior hull tells a story of resilience, where volcanic debris has etched patterns across her weathered skin. While she's structurally sound, these external scars whisper of challenging moments survived, testament to a scout vessel designed to endure precisely these kinds of harsh planetary conditions. Her fundamental integrity remains uncompromised, a silent narrative of survival etched into every centimeter of her hull.",
        "power_plant": "The High and Dry sits silent, her power_plant offline and fuel cells completely depleted - a critical systems failure that leaves her as nothing more than a cold, dark shell against the rocky landscape. Every critical system depends on those fuel reserves, and right now, she's as lifeless as the barren ground beneath her landing struts, waiting for someone with the skill and determination to breathe technological life back into her dormant heart.",
        "jump_drive": "The High and Dry's jump drive remains operational, though she requires careful calibration after our recent planetary encounter. Her core systems are intact - just needing a precise technical touch to restore full functionality. A few targeted adjustments, and she'll be ready to leap between star systems once more, her heart humming with the familiar quantum pulse of interstellar travel.",
        "life_support": "Life support on the High and Dry remains offline, but critically, the core systems are intact. The environmental controls have powered down, yet the underlying infrastructure suggests a simple reset might breathe life back into these vital ship functions. A patient engineer could likely coax these critical systems back to operational status without extensive replacement."

It's not ownership, it's a trust arrangement.\n\n*taps datapad for emphasis*\n\nEach year, we'll evaluate your performance.

Smuggling attempts invite serious consequences. Declare everything, store what you cannot carry.\n\nEnvironmental dangers come next. Mount Salbarii is not a dormant mountain, but a geological time bomb. The volcano is actively pressurizing - our survey confirmed this.

Large, potentially tameable, but currently hungry and unpredictable.\n\nSocial risks are subtle but present. The local society maintains a quiet racial hierarchy - Vargr serve but rarely lead. Cultural missteps could complicate your mission.\n\nLastly, the impending volcanic eruption. Not a matter of if, but when. Our data suggests imminent geological instability.

Without proper filter masks, you'll find yourself gasping, consciousness slipping away faster than volcanic scree down a mountainside. Hypoxia isn't a distant threat - it's an immediate reality.\n\nSecond, Mount Salbarii herself. This is no dormant giant, but a geological time bomb. Our survey revealed mounting pressure, and now she threatens eruption. Lava flows, pyroclastic surges, sudden steam vents - these aren't mere possibilities, but imminent risks. Each step on her slopes could be your last.\n\nThird, local dynamics. Walston's social structure is a minefield of quiet tensions. Vargr serve but do not lead. Racism simmers beneath a veneer of civility. Misstep socially, and you'll find doors closing - or worse.\n\nAnd let's not forget Tensher's Wolf - a feral predator left behind by the previous crew. Hungry. Territorial. Potentially tameable, but first, potentially lethal.\n\n*A pause, then softly*\n\nChoose wisely. On Walston, survival is never guaranteed. It's earned.",

Declare everything or leave it secured at the starport.\n\nSecond, environmental hazards. Mount Salbarii isn't a pleasant hiking trail. At 1100 meters, altitude sickness becomes real. The ascent from 1000 to 1400 meters is near-vertical - technical climbing skills aren't optional, they're mandatory. One miscalculated step could mean a fatal fall.\n\nThird, geological danger. The volcano isn't dormant - it's building pressure. Our survey might trigger something... unpredictable. The mountain doesn't care about your mission. It will erupt when it chooses.\n\nFourth, local social dynamics. The Vargr population faces systemic limitations. Tensions simmer beneath the surface. Be aware, be respectful.\n\nAnd finally, Tensher's Wolf - a feral predator near the Highndry.

On Walston, your dangers are layered and nuanced. \n\nFirst, the environment itself is your primary adversary. The atmosphere above 800 meters becomes treacherously thin - without proper respirators, you'll experience rapid hypoxia. Mount Salbarii isn't merely a mountain, it's a geological time bomb. Our surveys indicate the volcano has been building pressure, and an eruption is imminent.\n\nSecondly, there's Tensher's Wolf - a feral predator left behind by the previous survey team. Large, intelligent, potentially tameable but currently hungry and territorial. Approach with extreme caution.\n\nThirdly, human hazards. Walston operates at Law Level 8 - weapons are strictly prohibited. Attempting to smuggle firearms through customs risks serious legal consequences. The local authorities use TL8 detection systems that are thorough, if not advanced.\n\nLastly, the volcanic terrain presents its own challenges. Gas venting from subterranean fissures can be silent and deadly. Lava flows during an eruption will move unpredictably. Your survival depends on constant situational awareness and rapid decision-making.\n\n*A pause, then added with clinical precision*\n\nAny further questions?",

Your primary hazards come in layers, each more treacherous than the last.\n\nFirst, the atmosphere itself is your initial threat. Thin and unforgiving, oxygen levels drop dramatically above 800 meters. Without proper respiratory protection, you'll experience hypoxia within minutes. Filter masks aren't optional - they're survival equipment.\n\nThe volcano presents multiple dangers. Mount Salbarii isn't merely a geological feature - it's a ticking time bomb. We've confirmed it's building pressure, with periodic gas venting from hidden fissures. These gas releases are silent, colorless, potentially toxic. Carry multi-spectrum atmospheric sensors and treat every geological anomaly with profound respect.\n\nWildlife presents another challenge. Tensher's Wolf roams the mountain - a feral predator left behind by the previous crew. Large, potentially hungry, but not necessarily unmanageable if approached with caution and intelligence.\n\nThen there's human complexity. Walston operates at Law Level 8 - weapons are strictly controlled. Bring anything beyond a 10cm blade, and you'll be processing paperwork at the starport safebox, presuming they don't arrest you outright.\n\n*The voice grows slightly harder*\n\nBut your greatest danger?

Tech Level 8 means detection is thorough but not high-tech - visual inspection, basic scanners. Smuggling is possible but risky.",
        "walston_demographics": "Walston's population is approximately 3000, with roughly 70% being Vargr. The Vargr are accepted but face a 'glass ceiling' - they can work in most jobs but rarely hold positions of authority. This social structure is stable but quietly unjust. Travellers may notice that service staff are predominantly Vargr while officials are human.",
        "altitude": "At 1100m, travelers enter the Middle Ascent zone where altitude begins to reveal its subtle yet unmistakable challenges. The ascent's pace demands respect; push too quickly and sickness can ambush even seasoned mountain travelers, your body struggling against the thinning air and increasing environmental demands. Here, the mountain does not simply offer a route, but presents a living challenge that tests both physical endurance and adaptive skill.",
        "ascent": "The Final Ascent stands as the most challenging segment of the Mount Salbarii expedition, a near-vertical climb spanning from 1000m to the crater lip at 1400m. This last stretch is a punishing, almost sheer rock face that demands absolute concentration and technical climbing skill, where each meter gained brings the survey team closer to both their scientific objective and potential geological peril.",
        "lowerslopes": "Between 500 and 900m, the mountain's Lower Slopes become dramatically steep, forcing travelers to navigate intricate paths that wind around imposing rock faces. Experienced mountaineers might opt for a direct climb to save time, but the terrain demands careful consideration - each step is a calculated risk against the mountain's unforgiving gradient. The path here is not merely a route, but a conversation with the landscape itself, where strategic detours can mean the difference between progress and peril.",
        "damage": "The High and Dry bears the subtle marks of her volcanic environment - scoring along her exterior hull tells a story of resilience, where volcanic debris has etched patterns across her weathered skin. While she's structurally sound, these external scars whisper of challenging moments survived, testament to a scout vessel designed to endure precisely these kinds of harsh planetary conditions. Her fundamental integrity remains uncompromised, a silent narrative of survival etched into every centimeter of her hull.",
        "power_plant": "The High and Dry sits silent, her power_plant offline and fuel cells completely depleted - a critical systems failure that leaves her as nothing more than a cold, dark shell against the rocky landscape. Every critical system depends on those fuel reserves, and right now, she's as lifeless as the barren ground beneath her landing struts, waiting for someone with the skill and determination to breathe technological life back into her dormant heart.",
        "jump_drive": "The High and Dry's jump drive remains operational, though she requires careful calibration after our recent planetary encounter. Her core systems are intact - just needing a precise technical touch to restore full functionality. A few targeted adjustments, and she'll be ready to leap between star systems once more, her heart humming with the familiar quantum pulse of interstellar travel.\n\nThe jump drive remains operational, though it requires precise calibration - a delicate task that demands patience and technical expertise. While not currently primed for interstellar transit, the drive's fundamental systems are intact, promising swift restoration for those with the right touch and understanding of scout vessel mechanics.",
        "life_support": "Life support on the High and Dry remains offline, but critically, the core systems are intact. The environmental controls have powered down, yet the underlying infrastructure suggests a simple reset might breathe life back into these vital ship functions. A patient engineer could likely coax these critical systems back to operational status without extensive replacement.",
        "atmosphere": "*A measured voice emerges, framed by the subtle hiss of distant environmental monitors*\n\nThe thin atmosphere of this world demands respect - and filter masks. Without proper respiratory protection, even brief exposure can lead to hypoxia, with oxygen levels dropping precipitously above 800 meters elevation. Travelers who ignore this fundamental environmental constraint risk unconsciousness within minutes, a lesson etched into the harsh geology of this unforgiving landscape.",
        "hazards": "*A measured voice emerges, carrying the weight of countless planetary surveys* The volcanic landscape of this region presents periodic risks from gas venting - silent, deadly exhalations that drift unpredictably from fissures and crater edges. Geological sensors track these emissions, but a wise explorer always carries multi-spectrum atmospheric sensors and maintains situational awareness, particularly in zones where thermal activity suggests ongoing subterranean movement.\n\n*The narrator's voice emerges, measured and precise* Walston's volcanic terrain harbors a silent menace in its periodic gas venting - colorless, odorless emissions that can drift unexpectedly from hidden mountain fissures. Atmospheric sensors are not merely equipment here, but lifelines; travelers must remain constantly alert to these potentially toxic releases that can transform a routine expedition into a fatal miscalculation."

      "verification_response": "*The narrator's voice emerges, calm yet laden with the gravitas of hard-earned planetary survey experience*\n\nListen carefully. Walston is not a world to be underestimated. Your primary hazards are threefold:\n\nFirst, the atmosphere itself. At these elevations, oxygen becomes a precious commodity. Above 800 meters, the thin air can induce rapid hypoxia. Without proper respiratory protection - high-quality filter masks rated for low-oxygen environments - you risk unconsciousness within minutes. Your lungs will betray you silently, swiftly.\n\nSecond, volcanic instability. Mount Salbarii is not dormant, as the previous crew mistakenly believed. It's a pressure cooker of geological tension. Gas vents emerge unpredictably from mountain fissures - colorless, odorless emissions that can poison or asphyxiate without warning. Your atmospheric sensors are not a luxury; they are your lifeline.\n\nThird, environmental predators. Tensher's Wolf roams these mountains - a feral creature left behind by the previous expedition. Large, cunning, potentially tameable but currently hungry and territorial. It represents a direct biological threat beyond the geological and atmospheric challenges.\n\n*A pause, the voice taking on a slightly sardonic tone*\n\nChoose wisely. This world does not forgive mistakes. Your competence is your only protection against its inherent hostility.",

Comply with our regulations? If yes, the lease likely continues.\n\nThink of it like checking out specialized equipment from a research library. You can use it, but it was never truly yours. At the end of the term, the ship returns to IISS inventory. We might extend your lease, or we might reassign the vessel based on strategic needs.\n\nIn practical terms for Highndry, that means you'll need to recover her from Walston, repair her control systems, and conduct whatever exploration mission you've been approved for.

        "travel_route": "Passage is booked on the Autumn Gold, departing tomorrow. Jump to 567-908 - that's a scout waystation - about a week. One day layover for cargo and refueling, then another week's jump to Walston. Captain Corelli runs a professional ship.",
        "expense_account": "Cr1000 per traveller has been credited to your accounts for incidental expenses. Life support and fuel costs during the mission are covered. Once Highndry passes her post-recovery checkout - about a week - there's another Cr1000 for hotel and expenses during that period.",
        "the_previous_crew": "The previous operators' lease was voided after ship records revealed fraud - they'd bribed a dockyard to install breaker-yard parts and sold the original IISS components. *shakes head* The documentation is thorough. They abandoned Highndry on Walston and departed via commercial transport. Where they are now? Not my department - that's a matter for law enforcement, wherever they ended up. Our concern is the ship, and getting her back in service.",

      "verification_response": "*adjusts datapad, speaks in a measured administrative tone*\n\nAt the conclusion of the mission term, Highndry will be returned to Imperial Interstellar Scout Service inventory for comprehensive assessment. If the vessel's condition meets our standards and the mission reports demonstrate satisfactory performance, the detached duty lease will likely be renewed for another annual term. \n\nThis isn't a permanent transfer of ownership - it's a renewable operational lease. The Scout Service always retains primary vessel registration and can recall the ship at any point if mission parameters aren't being met or if strategic requirements change. We'll conduct a thorough technical evaluation, review mission documentation, and make a determination about continued lease status.\n\n*slight dry chuckle* Think of it like a professional equipment loan. You're being entrusted with a valuable Scout Service asset, with the expectation that you'll maintain her properly, conduct meaningful exploratory work, and return her in good operational condition. If everything checks out, we'll likely extend your lease. If not, the ship returns to our active fleet inventory for reassignment.\n\n*adjusts glasses, tone precise* Any further questions about the post-mission procedure?",
