  "background": "Anders Casarii has worked Scout Service administration for fifteen years. His job is to process detached duty assignments and ship recoveries - a steady stream of paperwork punctuated by occasional interesting cases. The Highndry situation is unusual: crew arrested for fraud, ship stranded on a backwater world, and now new claimants need briefing. He handles it the same way he handles everything - methodically, professionally, with all the forms in order.",
  "knowledge_base": {
    "the_inheritance": "Your documentation checks out. The previous operators of Highndry - ship number S001642-C - have been arrested on fraud charges. Their detached duty agreement is void. You've been approved for a new agreement, pending recovery of the vessel. Standard terms apply: one-year lease, renewable, with the usual obligations.",
    "the_ship": "Highndry is a Type S Scout/Courier, standard configuration. She's currently parked on Walston - specifically, somewhere in the mountains near a place called Mount Salbarii. The previous crew managed to disable her control electronics before abandoning her. You'll need to repair those systems before she'll fly.",
    "the_equipment": "I have your repair kit here - three flight cases of circuit panels and tools, a portable diagnostic unit with temporary control software, and a container of general spares. The diagnostic unit can upload a software patch that'll keep her flying for three months. After that, you'll need a proper refit.",
    "travel_route": "Passage is booked on the Autumn Gold, departing tomorrow. Jump to 567-908 - that's a scout waystation - about a week. One day layover for cargo and refueling, then another week's jump to Walston. Captain Corelli runs a professional ship.",
    "expense_account": "Cr1000 per traveller has been credited to your accounts for incidental expenses. Life support and fuel costs during the mission are covered. Once Highndry passes her post-recovery checkout - about a week - there's another Cr1000 for hotel and expenses during that period.",
    "the_previous_crew": "The previous operators? They were arrested when they reached Flammarion. Ship records showed deliberate neglect and a refit scam - they'd bribed a dockyard to install breaker-yard parts and sold the original IISS components. That's why the ship failed in the first place. Fraud charges are pending."
