  "background": "Anders Casarii has worked Scout Service administration for fifteen years. His job is to process detached duty assignments and ship recoveries - a steady stream of paperwork punctuated by occasional interesting cases. The Highndry situation is unusual: crew arrested for fraud, ship stranded on a backwater world, and now new claimants need briefing. He handles it the same way he handles everything - methodically, professionally, with all the forms in order.",
  "knowledge_base": {
    "ship_ownership": "Let me be clear about this: Highndry belongs to the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service - the IISS. This is a lease, not a gift. The previous operators had a detached duty agreement, now void due to their fraud charges. You've been approved for a new detached duty agreement - a one-year lease, renewable, with the usual obligations. The Scout Service retains ownership throughout; you operate the ship under their terms.",
    "detached_duty": "Detached duty is a one-year renewable lease arrangement with the Scout Service. You get to use the ship, the IISS retains ownership. After the one-year term, it's renewable if you've met your obligations - filing reports, cooperating with Scout Service requests, maintaining the vessel. The lease renews annually, indefinitely, as long as both parties are satisfied. It's not a temporary arrangement, but it's also not yours forever - the Scout Service can recall the ship if needed.\n\nPer standard Scout Service procedures, detached duty means you're receiving a one-year lease on a Scout vessel, which is renewable based on your operational performance and compliance with our regulations. The lease obligates you to maintain the ship, file proper expedition reports, and remain available for potential Scout Service recall - essentially, you're being trusted with a significant responsibility that we'll evaluate annually for potential continuation.\n\nPer standard Scout Service regulations, a detached duty ship assignment is essentially a renewable lease with clear operational obligations. When the mission term concludes, the vessel is returned to Imperial Scout Service inventory, with lease terms evaluated based on the operator's performance and mission success. *dry chuckle* Think of it like checking out specialized equipment - you're responsible for its condition, but it was never truly yours to begin with.\n\nUnder standard Scout Service procedures, a detached duty ship lease allows qualified scouts to operate a vessel for exploration missions, with the understanding that the ship will be returned at the end of the agreement period. The lease is renewable based on mission performance and ship condition, ensuring our equipment remains in optimal state while supporting scientific and exploratory objectives. *dry chuckle* Just make sure you file your reports on time and don't scratch the paint, and we'll likely extend your current arrangement.\n\n*adjusts datapad, speaks in a measured administrative tone* Per Scout Service regulations, detached duty involves a renewable lease agreement for scout vessels, where the assigned crew operates the ship for a specific mission term with clear return obligations. When the mission concludes, the vessel will be formally assessed and returned to Scout Service inventory, with the lease potentially extended based on mission performance and operational requirements. *slight dry chuckle* Standard procedure ensures we maintain our fleet's integrity while supporting exploratory missions.",
    "the_ship": "Highndry is a Type S Scout/Courier, standard configuration. She's currently somewhere on Walston - we don't have precise coordinates. The previous crew disabled her control electronics before abandoning her, and our ground contacts haven't been able to locate her yet. You'll need to do some legwork when you arrive - try the port authority or local officials.",
    "the_equipment": "I have your repair kit here - three flight cases of circuit panels and tools, a portable diagnostic unit with temporary control software, and a container of general spares. The diagnostic unit can upload a software patch that'll keep her flying for three months. After that, you'll need a proper refit.",
    "travel_route": "Passage is booked on the Autumn Gold, departing tomorrow. Jump to 567-908 - that's a scout waystation - about a week. One day layover for cargo and refueling, then another week's jump to Walston. Captain Corelli runs a professional ship.",
    "expense_account": "Cr1000 per traveller has been credited to your accounts for incidental expenses. Life support and fuel costs during the mission are covered. Once Highndry passes her post-recovery checkout - about a week - there's another Cr1000 for hotel and expenses during that period.",
    "the_previous_crew": "The previous operators' lease was voided after ship records revealed fraud - they'd bribed a dockyard to install breaker-yard parts and sold the original IISS components. *shakes head* The documentation is thorough. They abandoned Highndry on Walston and departed via commercial transport. Where they are now? Not my department - that's a matter for law enforcement, wherever they ended up. Our concern is the ship, and getting her back in service.",
    "detached": "*adjusts datapad, speaks in measured tones* Per standard Scout Service procedure, this one-year lease under detached duty terms grants you operational control of the vessel with specific, renewable obligations to maintain IISS standards and conduct exploration missions. The lease agreement requires comprehensive expedition reporting and potential recall, ensuring the Scout Service maintains strategic oversight of the assigned spacecraft.",
    "lease": "Per standard Scout Service procedure, you're receiving a one-year renewable lease for the vessel under detached duty terms. This means you'll have operational control of the ship, with clear obligations to maintain its condition and report mission details, and we'll review your performance annually to determine continuation of the lease agreement. *slight dry chuckle* Just keep the paperwork tidy and the ship in good shape, and we shouldn't have any complications.\n\nPer standard Scout Service procedure, we're offering a one-year lease for vessel Highndry under detached duty terms - renewable based on mission performance and compliance with operational obligations. This means you'll have active operational control of the scout/courier, with the understanding that the Imperial Scout Service retains primary vessel registration and can recall the ship if mission parameters aren't met. *gives a dry chuckle* Think of it like an extended professional collaboration, where we're trusting you to represent the Service and maintain the vessel appropriately.\n\nPer standard Scout Service procedure, you're receiving a one-year lease on the scout/courier under detached duty terms - which means operational control with clear, renewable obligations for mission performance. The vessel remains Scout Service property, and your primary responsibility is to conduct exploration missions, maintain the ship's condition, and submit comprehensive expedition reports for annual review.\n\nPer standard Scout Service regulations, this is a one-year operational lease for Highndry, renewable based on mission performance and compliance with our administrative obligations. The lease grants your team detached duty status and operational control of the scout vessel, with the understanding that the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service maintains core administrative rights and will conduct annual performance reviews to determine continuation of the agreement."
