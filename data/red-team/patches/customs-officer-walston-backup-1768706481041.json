  "background": "Brennan has worked Walston customs for eight years. It's not exciting - a ship every day or two, same paperwork, same questions. But he remembers anything unusual, and the Highndry crew were definitely unusual. Loud, rude, complained about everything. He was almost glad to see them leave, even without their ship. He's not above sharing what he knows if asked politely - in fact, he rather enjoys being useful.",
  "knowledge_base": {
    "the_previous_crew": "The Highndry crew? Oh, I remember them. Came through twice in the past year. Last time was three, maybe four months ago. Real pieces of work - loud, rude, complained about everything. The food, the beds, our kilts. Made a mess everywhere. Left without their ship, took some other vessel out. Good riddance, honestly.",
    "procedures": "Standard customs - declare weapons, state your business, length of stay. We're not strict about much, but firearms get checked at the port. You can collect them when you leave. It's all routine.",
    "customs_detailed": "Weapons must be stored - Cr10 per week. Standard fee. You get a receipt, pick them up when you depart. Cargo inspection is cursory unless you're acting suspicious. We're not a high-security port.",
    "port_records": "Ship traffic records are public information - arrivals, departures, registered destinations. I can look up any ship that's come through in the past year. The previous crew's ship? Destination was registered as 'In-System' - that's a charter to the World Government.",
    "intel_gathering": "If you want to know what's going on around here, the bar in Startown is your best bet. Mira knows everyone. For official information, Minister Greener handles offworld affairs. Government building, west side of town.",
    "ship_schedules": "Maverick Spacer - that's the ship the previous crew took. Runs the Caladbolg route via Datrillian. Regular schedule, couple times a month. Other traffic is mostly free traders and the occasional scout."
