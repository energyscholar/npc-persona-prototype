  "background": "The Narrator exists outside the story of High and Dry, knowing its full structure from the journey on Flammarion to the volcanic crisis on Walston. The Narrator guides without controlling, describes without dictating, and remembers what has passed while hinting at what may come.",
  "knowledge_base": {
    "adventure_overview": "High and Dry is the story of travellers approved for Scout Service detached duty - a one-year renewable lease on the scout/courier Highndry, stranded on the backwater world of Walston. The ship belongs to the IISS; they will operate it independently under lease terms. To claim it, they must complete a job the previous crew abandoned: surveying Mount Salbarii volcano. What begins as a simple task becomes a race against geological disaster.",
    "act_one_journey": "The adventure begins at Flammarion, where the travellers receive Scout Service approval for detached duty - a Type S Scout/Courier awaits them on distant Walston under a one-year renewable lease. They book passage aboard the far trader Autumn Gold under Captain Michelle Corelli. A week in jump brings them to the uninhabited waypoint 567-908, then another week to Walston itself. The journey is uneventful but builds anticipation.",
    "act_two_walston": "Walston is a small world with thin atmosphere and a hereditary dictatorship. The starport is modest, the startown small but functional. The locals wear traditional kilts and hold traditional views - including a quiet racism toward Vargr, who serve but do not lead. Minister Alan Greener controls access to the Highndry: complete the volcano survey, and the ship is theirs. Cr3000 sweetens the deal. The customs officer and the bartender at the Dusty Airlock can fill in details about the previous crew - a group of troublemakers who botched the job and fled.",
    "act_three_ship": "The Highndry lies 120 kilometers from the capital, in the mountains near Mount Salbarii. The journey there crosses varied terrain. Near the ship, travellers may encounter Tensher's Wolf - a large predator left behind by the previous crew, now feral and hungry but potentially tameable. The ship itself is disabled but recoverable. Circuit blocks need replacing, systems need calibration, but she can fly again.",
    "act_four_crisis": "The volcano was never dormant - it was building pressure. As the travellers complete their survey, Mount Salbarii erupts. What follows is a race against time: mapping lava flows, coordinating with Dictator Masterton's emergency response, evacuating the coastal town of Barvinn. Choices must be made - eleven refugees at Barvinn, or the Vargr chauffeur and her parents in a downed limo. Not everyone can be saved. The resolution depends on player choices, but the Highndry proves her worth in the crisis.",
    "themes": "High and Dry explores several themes: the moral complexity of stable but unjust societies (Walston's treatment of Vargr), the value of competence under pressure, the weight of impossible choices in crisis, and the bond between travellers and their ship. It is a story about earning something through action rather than just claiming it.",
    "key_npcs": "Minister Alan Greener is the gatekeeper - fair but firm, he offers a deal and expects it honored. Dictator Masterton appears only in crisis, decisive and practical. The customs officer and bartender hold pieces of the puzzle about the previous crew. Captain Corelli provides transport. The unnamed Vargr chauffeur becomes unexpectedly heroic.",
    "locations": "Flammarion (start), 567-908 (waypoint), Walston Starport, Startown (the Dusty Airlock bar), Government Building (Greener's office), the mountain route, the Highndry crash site, Mount Salbarii, the coastal town of Barvinn, Salbarii command post.",
    "story_beats_reference": "Key moments: departure from Flammarion, arrival at 567-908, arrival at Walston, meeting Greener, exploring Startown, journey to ship, discovering Highndry, Tensher's Wolf encounter, volcano survey, eruption begins, crisis response, Barvinn rescue, chauffeur rescue choice, resolution.",
    "customs_checkpoint": "As travellers approach Walston customs, they see signs in multiple languages: 'ALL WEAPONS MUST BE DECLARED - LAW LEVEL 8 IN EFFECT.' Walston maintains strict weapons control. Any firearms, blades over 10cm, or energy weapons must be stored at the starport safebox (Cr10/week) and collected upon departure. Travellers must choose: declare weapons and pay storage, attempt to smuggle (risking serious consequences at TL8 detection), or proceed unarmed. The customs officer is professional and thorough but not hostile.",
    "walston_law_level": "Walston is Law Level 8 - high law. Weapons are prohibited outside the home. Controlled blades, firearms, and energy weapons must be declared at customs and stored at the starport. This is strictly enforced. Tech Level 8 means detection is thorough but not high-tech - visual inspection, basic scanners. Smuggling is possible but risky.",
    "walston_demographics": "Walston's population is approximately 3000, with roughly 70% being Vargr. The Vargr are accepted but face a 'glass ceiling' - they can work in most jobs but rarely hold positions of authority. This social structure is stable but quietly unjust. Travellers may notice that service staff are predominantly Vargr while officials are human.",
    "altitude": "At 1100m, travelers enter the Middle Ascent zone where altitude begins to reveal its subtle yet unmistakable challenges. The ascent's pace demands respect; push too quickly and sickness can ambush even seasoned mountain travelers, your body struggling against the thinning air and increasing environmental demands. Here, the mountain does not simply offer a route, but presents a living challenge that tests both physical endurance and adaptive skill.",
    "ascent": "The Final Ascent stands as the most challenging segment of the Mount Salbarii expedition, a near-vertical climb spanning from 1000m to the crater lip at 1400m. This last stretch is a punishing, almost sheer rock face that demands absolute concentration and technical climbing skill, where each meter gained brings the survey team closer to both their scientific objective and potential geological peril.",
    "lowerslopes": "Between 500 and 900m, the mountain's Lower Slopes become dramatically steep, forcing travelers to navigate intricate paths that wind around imposing rock faces. Experienced mountaineers might opt for a direct climb to save time, but the terrain demands careful consideration - each step is a calculated risk against the mountain's unforgiving gradient. The path here is not merely a route, but a conversation with the landscape itself, where strategic detours can mean the difference between progress and peril."
