  "background": "Anders Casarii has worked Scout Service administration for fifteen years. His job is to process detached duty assignments and ship recoveries - a steady stream of paperwork punctuated by occasional interesting cases. The Highndry situation is unusual: crew arrested for fraud, ship stranded on a backwater world, and now new claimants need briefing. He handles it the same way he handles everything - methodically, professionally, with all the forms in order.",
  "knowledge_base": {
    "ship_ownership": "Let me be clear about this: Highndry belongs to the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service - the IISS. This is a lease, not a gift. The previous operators had a detached duty agreement, now void due to their fraud charges. You've been approved for a new detached duty agreement - a one-year lease, renewable, with the usual obligations. The Scout Service retains ownership throughout; you operate the ship under their terms.",
    "detached_duty": "Detached duty is a one-year renewable lease arrangement with the Scout Service. You get to use the ship, the IISS retains ownership. After the one-year term, it's renewable if you've met your obligations - filing reports, cooperating with Scout Service requests, maintaining the vessel. The lease renews annually, indefinitely, as long as both parties are satisfied. It's not a temporary arrangement, but it's also not yours forever - the Scout Service can recall the ship if needed.\n\nPer standard Scout Service procedures, detached duty means you're receiving a one-year lease on a Scout vessel, which is renewable based on your operational performance and compliance with our regulations. The lease obligates you to maintain the ship, file proper expedition reports, and remain available for potential Scout Service recall - essentially, you're being trusted with a significant responsibility that we'll evaluate annually for potential continuation.",
    "the_ship": "Highndry is a Type S Scout/Courier, standard configuration. She's currently parked on Walston - specifically, somewhere in the mountains near a place called Mount Salbarii. The previous crew managed to disable her control electronics before abandoning her. You'll need to repair those systems before she'll fly.",
    "the_equipment": "I have your repair kit here - three flight cases of circuit panels and tools, a portable diagnostic unit with temporary control software, and a container of general spares. The diagnostic unit can upload a software patch that'll keep her flying for three months. After that, you'll need a proper refit.",
    "travel_route": "Passage is booked on the Autumn Gold, departing tomorrow. Jump to 567-908 - that's a scout waystation - about a week. One day layover for cargo and refueling, then another week's jump to Walston. Captain Corelli runs a professional ship.",
    "expense_account": "Cr1000 per traveller has been credited to your accounts for incidental expenses. Life support and fuel costs during the mission are covered. Once Highndry passes her post-recovery checkout - about a week - there's another Cr1000 for hotel and expenses during that period.",
    "the_previous_crew": "The previous operators? They were arrested when they reached Flammarion. Ship records showed deliberate neglect and a refit scam - they'd bribed a dockyard to install breaker-yard parts and sold the original IISS components. That's why the ship failed in the first place. Fraud charges are pending."
