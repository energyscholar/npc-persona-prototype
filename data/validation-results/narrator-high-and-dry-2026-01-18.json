When a scout vessel like the Highndry is placed on detached duty, it means the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service has authorized an independent crew to operate the vessel under a specific lease agreement. \n\nIn our case, this means the travellers have been granted a one-year renewable lease on the Highndry. They aren't purchasing the ship, but effectively renting it from the IISS with the understanding that they will complete specific mission objectives. Here, that objective is the completion of the abandoned Mount Salbarii volcano survey.\n\nThe lease terms are straightforward but precise: successfully survey the volcano, and the ship becomes their operational base for the next year. Minister Alan Greener acts as the IISS representative, holding the administrative keys, so to speak. The Cr3000 offered is both incentive and partial compensation for taking on this abandoned mission.\n\nFor the Highndry herself, detached duty means transitioning from a structured Scout Service deployment to an independent operational status. Her systems remain IISS property, but her day-to-day management transfers to this new crew. Their competence will determine whether the lease is renewed - a fact that adds both opportunity and pressure to their mission.\n\n*A subtle mechanical hum accompanies the final words, as if the ship herself is listening*",

Humans form the ruling class, with a hereditary dictatorship led by Dictator Masterton, while Vargr occupy a complex social stratum.\n\nThe local demographic tells a nuanced story: approximately 3000 inhabitants, with 70% being Vargr.

Her power plant is completely offline, with fuel cells fully depleted - essentially rendering her a cold, lifeless hull against the rocky Walston landscape. While her jump drive remains fundamentally operational, it demands precise calibration after the volcanic encounter. Life support systems are offline but structurally intact, suggesting a potential reset rather than full replacement.\n\nCircuit blocks need replacing throughout her systems, and comprehensive calibration is essential. Her exterior bears volcanic scoring - visual evidence of her challenging environment - but her fundamental structural integrity remains sound. \n\nShe's disabled, not destroyed. With skilled technical intervention, the High and Dry can fly again. The circuits, power restoration, and careful recalibration are the key challenges.

      "response": "*A deep, measured voice emerges, carrying the tone of a seasoned expedition narrator*\n\nListen carefully. On Walston, danger is not a single threat, but a layered challenge that demands constant vigilance.\n\nFirst, the environment itself is your primary adversary. The thin atmosphere becomes increasingly treacherous as you ascend Mount Salbarii. Above 800 meters, oxygen levels drop precipitously. Without proper respiratory protection, you'll risk hypoxia - unconsciousness can strike within minutes. Your filter mask is not a luxury, but a lifeline.\n\nVolcanic hazards are ever-present. Silent gas vents can emerge unpredictably from fissures and crater edges. These are colorless, odorless killers that multi-spectrum sensors are your only defense against. The mountain is not dormant, but a breathing, unpredictable entity.\n\nThen there's Tensher's Wolf - a feral predator left behind by the previous expedition. Large, hungry, potentially tameable but currently dangerous. It roams near the Highndry's crash site, a reminder that biological threats complement geological ones.\n\nLegally, you must navigate Walston's strict weapons control. Law Level 8 means any undeclared weapon risks severe consequences. Customs will thoroughly inspect all equipment. One mistake could terminate your entire mission before it begins.\n\nAnd underlying all: the impending volcanic eruption. Mount Salbarii is not sleeping, but building pressure. Your survey might be the thin line between preparation and catastrophe.\n\n*The voice drops to a portentous whisper*\n\nChoose wisely. On this world, survival is not guaranteed - it is earned.",

Your primary hazards come in layers, each more treacherous than the last.\n\nFirst, the atmosphere itself is your initial threat. Thin and unforgiving, oxygen levels drop dramatically above 800 meters. Without proper respiratory protection, you'll experience hypoxia within minutes. Filter masks aren't optional - they're survival equipment.\n\nThe volcano presents multiple dangers. Mount Salbarii isn't merely a geological feature - it's a ticking time bomb. We've confirmed it's building pressure, with periodic gas venting from hidden fissures. These gas releases are silent, colorless, potentially toxic. Carry multi-spectrum atmospheric sensors and treat every geological anomaly with profound respect.\n\nWildlife presents another challenge. Tensher's Wolf roams the mountain - a feral predator left behind by the previous crew. Large, potentially hungry, but not necessarily unmanageable if approached with caution and intelligence.\n\nThen there's human complexity. Walston operates at Law Level 8 - weapons are strictly controlled. Bring anything beyond a 10cm blade, and you'll be processing paperwork at the starport safebox, presuming they don't arrest you outright.\n\n*The voice grows slightly harder*\n\nBut your greatest danger?
