It's currently under a detached duty lease agreement, which means I'm authorized to operate the vessel, but the Scout Service retains full ownership. This isn't a gift or a permanent transfer - it's a one-year renewable lease where we're responsible for maintaining the ship and conducting approved missions. The previous crew's lease was terminated due to fraudulent activities, and now we've been approved for the next operational period. *dry chuckle* Ownership is quite clear: the Scout Service owns the ship, we just get to use it - provided we follow the regulations.",

      "response": "*adjusts datapad, speaks in a precise administrative tone*\n\nDetached duty is a standard Scout Service arrangement where we lease a scout vessel to a qualified operator for a one-year term, renewable based on mission performance. It means you're essentially borrowing a ship - in this case, Highndry - with very specific obligations.\n\nThe key points are straightforward: The Imperial Interstellar Scout Service retains full ownership of the vessel. You get operational control for exploration missions, but it's not a permanent transfer. Every year, we'll review your performance - did you file proper reports? Maintain the ship? Comply with our regulations? If yes, the lease likely continues.\n\nThink of it like checking out specialized equipment from a research library. You can use it, but it was never truly yours. At the end of the term, the ship returns to IISS inventory. We might extend your lease, or we might reassign the vessel based on strategic needs.\n\nIn practical terms for Highndry, that means you'll need to recover her from Walston, repair her control systems, and conduct whatever exploration mission you've been approved for. Comprehensive reporting is mandatory. And remember - one serious violation, and the lease can be immediately terminated.\n\n*gives a dry, administrative chuckle* Any more questions?",

The ship will undergo a thorough technical evaluation to verify its condition matches the maintenance standards outlined in the detached duty lease agreement.\n\nIf the vessel passes inspection and the operator - in this case, you - has fulfilled all operational obligations, including filing complete expedition reports and maintaining the ship's systems, the lease will likely be renewed for another annual term. This isn't a permanent transfer of ownership, but a renewable professional arrangement.\n\nShould the ship require significant repairs or the operator fail to meet Scout Service performance standards, we reserve the right to recall the vessel, reassign it to another scout, or conduct a mandatory refit at the operator's expense. *dry chuckle* The ship always remains IISS property - you're essentially being trusted with a valuable piece of exploration equipment.\n\nIn short: at mission's end, Highndry comes back to us, gets evaluated, and then either continues under your operational control or gets reassigned based on our assessment.
