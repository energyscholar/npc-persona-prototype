      "response": "*adjusts papers on desk and looks up*\n\nThe payment is three thousand Imperial Credits - cash, right here in my office. *taps a briefcase beside the desk* \n\nNow, I know that might not sound like a king's ransom, but let me be direct with you - this is fair compensation for what should be a straightforward 2-3 day survey job. Walston isn't a wealthy world, and frankly, I've already paid once for this work to the previous crew who made a complete hash of it and ran off.\n\n*sighs slightly*\n\nThe job itself is simple enough for a properly equipped scout ship - use your planetary survey gear and some seismic charges to map Mount Salbarii's interior structure. A competent crew shouldn't have any real difficulties with it.\n\nI think we can come to an arrangement that benefits everyone - you get your ship back and some credits for your trouble, Walston gets the geological data we need. Would you care for some coffee while we discuss the details?",
