Vargr here are the backbone of this community - they run most of the service jobs, are incredible workers, totally integrated.

But there's this... unspoken understanding. Vargr are respected, valued, but when it comes to top positions in government, corporations, you'll mostly see human faces. \n\nThey're not fighting it, and that might seem strange to offworlders. But this is Walston. We have our traditions. The Vargr here, they work within the system. They're pragmatic. Good people, hardworking. *leans in* Just don't come in thinking you're gonna \"fix\" anything. That'll just make everyone uncomfortable.\n\n*goes back to polishing the glass* Anything else you want to know?",

First thing you'll notice? The kilts. And I mean everyone - men, women, doesn't matter. It's not a joke, it's tradition. Been that way for generations. Laugh about it, and you'll be the one looking foolish.\n\nWe've got a substantial Vargr population here - about 70% of our service industry. They're integral to our community, hardworking folks. But there's... let's call it a \"traditional\" social structure. They're respected, absolutely, but leadership? That tends to stay with humans. It's not malicious, just... how things are.\n\n*Takes a swig from a glass of something amber*\n\nIf you're new here, a couple quick tips. Minister Greener? When he makes a deal, he means it. Straight up, no tricks. And the Vargr? Don't try to \"fix\" their social situation. Offworlders coming in with grand ideas always makes things more complicated.\n\nAny other questions? *raises an eyebrow*",
