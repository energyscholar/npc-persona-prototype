Essentially, if you're not inside your own residence, you cannot legally carry anything that could be construed as a weapon. And I mean anything - personal blades, stunners, even most civilian defensive tools are prohibited. \n\nWhen you arrive at the starport, all weapons will be immediately catalogued, tagged, and secured in our armory. We'll provide you a receipt, and you can collect them when departing. Storage costs Cr10 per week. No exceptions, no negotiations.\n\n*leans forward slightly, with a stern professional gaze*\n\nAny attempt to conceal a weapon or bypass our procedures will result in immediate legal action. We take these regulations seriously. Visitors must understand: on Walston, personal security is handled by local law enforcement. Civilians do not arm themselves. Period.\n\n*sits back, waiting for any follow-up questions*",

Firearms, blades longer than 10cm, anything that could be considered a weapon gets logged and locked up. You can retrieve your items when departing the planet.
