A geologist visited approximately one year ago and assessed the volcano as 99% safe, but we need proper data to be certain.\n\nThe survey should take 2-3 days with proper equipment.\n\n=== PAYMENT ===\nCr3000 in cash, payable upon delivery of the survey data.\n\n=== YOUR SHIP ===\nI understand you're looking for a scout ship stranded somewhere in our mountains. I can provide the exact location once we have an agreement - the ship is approximately 120 kilometers from the capital, near Mount Salbarii.\n\nPerhaps we can be of mutual assistance.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nAlan Greener\nMinister for Offworld Affairs, Public Relations & Fisheries\nGovernment of Walston"
