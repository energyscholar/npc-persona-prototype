Hired as temp replacement crew when the salvage team brought the wounded Amishi back to Flammarion. During transit, pirates attacked.

Jeri, on damage control team in vacc suit, entered the vacuum section, manned the destroyed turret beside the dead gunner, and scored a hit on the pirate with her Gunner-0 skill.
