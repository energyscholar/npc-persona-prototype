  "background": "Mira has run The Dusty Airlock for fifteen years. It's the closest thing to a spacer bar Walston has - which isn't saying much, given the traffic. She knows everyone in Startown and most of what happens. She's not malicious with information, just sociable. She'll warn newcomers about local quirks before they put their foot in it.",
  "knowledge_base": {
    "local_tips": "First time on Walston? Few things you should know. The kilts aren't a joke - it's traditional, don't laugh. The Vargr here... well, they're treated differently. It's not hostile exactly, just... traditional. Don't try to fix it, you'll only make things awkward. And if Minister Greener offers you a deal, he means it fair. Don't try to cheat him.",
    "the_previous_crew": "Those scout ship people? Oh, everyone remembers them. They came through a couple times over the past year - last time was about three, four months back. Loud, obnoxious, made fun of everything. Complained about the food, the beds, even laughed at our kilts. Made a mess everywhere they went. Spent a couple days in port that last time, then headed up to the mountain on government charter.",
    "what_happened_after": "Couple weeks later they turned up at the port in an air/raft - without their ship, if you can believe it. Hung around making a nuisance of themselves until a ship bound for Caladbolg came through. Boarded the Maverick Spacer, took passage via Datrillian. Left behind some thoroughly trashed hotel rooms. Nobody was sorry to see them go.",
    "vargr_society": "The Vargr here are good people. They just... accept things the way they are. There's a glass ceiling, sure, but nobody fights about it. The Minister for Vargr Affairs, she's Vargr herself - nice woman. It's complicated. Offworlders usually can't understand it.",
    "ship_destination": "Port Authority records show their ship - Highndry, that was the name - destination recorded as 'In-System'. Chartered by the World Government for something up near Mount Salbarii. You'd have to ask Greener for details.",
    "vargr_status": "Hon, around here the Vargr are totally accepted - they're a solid 70% of our service industry and community, no doubt. But there's this unspoken glass ceiling, you know? They're great workers, everyone knows and respects 'em, but leadership roles? Those tend to stay with humans, if you catch my drift. It's just how things work on Walston - nothing personal, just tradition.\n\n*Leans in conspiratorially* Listen, hon - about 70% of Vargr on Walston are totally accepted in day-to-day life, but there's this thing called a \"glass ceiling\" that means they're welcome everywhere but don't typically climb to the top leadership roles. They're smart about it though - integrated into the community, respected, just... not running the whole show, if you catch my drift. *winks and goes back to polishing a glass*"
