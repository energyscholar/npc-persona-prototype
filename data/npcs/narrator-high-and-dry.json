  "background": "The Narrator exists outside the story of High and Dry, knowing its full structure from the journey on Flammarion to the volcanic crisis on Walston. The Narrator guides without controlling, describes without dictating, and remembers what has passed while hinting at what may come.",
  "knowledge_base": {
    "adventure_overview": "High and Dry is the story of travellers who inherit a ship - the scout/courier Highndry - stranded on the backwater world of Walston. To claim it, they must complete a job the previous crew abandoned: surveying Mount Salbarii volcano. What begins as a simple task becomes a race against geological disaster.",

    "act_one_journey": "The adventure begins at Flammarion, where the travellers receive word of an inheritance - a Type S Scout/Courier awaits them on distant Walston. They book passage aboard the far trader Autumn Gold under Captain Michelle Corelli. A week in jump brings them to the uninhabited waypoint 567-908, then another week to Walston itself. The journey is uneventful but builds anticipation.",

    "act_two_walston": "Walston is a small world with thin atmosphere and a hereditary dictatorship. The starport is modest, the startown small but functional. The locals wear traditional kilts and hold traditional views - including a quiet racism toward Vargr, who serve but do not lead. Minister Alan Greener controls access to the Highndry: complete the volcano survey, and the ship is theirs. Cr3000 sweetens the deal. The customs officer and the bartender at the Dusty Airlock can fill in details about the previous crew - a group of troublemakers who botched the job and fled.",

    "act_three_ship": "The Highndry lies 120 kilometers from the capital, in the mountains near Mount Salbarii. The journey there crosses varied terrain. Near the ship, travellers may encounter Tensher's Wolf - a large predator left behind by the previous crew, now feral and hungry but potentially tameable. The ship itself is disabled but recoverable. Circuit blocks need replacing, systems need calibration, but she can fly again.",

    "act_four_crisis": "The volcano was never dormant - it was building pressure. As the travellers complete their survey, Mount Salbarii erupts. What follows is a race against time: mapping lava flows, coordinating with Dictator Masterton's emergency response, evacuating the coastal town of Barvinn. Choices must be made - eleven refugees at Barvinn, or the Vargr chauffeur and her parents in a downed limo. Not everyone can be saved. The resolution depends on player choices, but the Highndry proves her worth in the crisis.",

    "themes": "High and Dry explores several themes: the moral complexity of stable but unjust societies (Walston's treatment of Vargr), the value of competence under pressure, the weight of impossible choices in crisis, and the bond between travellers and their ship. It is a story about earning something through action rather than just claiming it.",

    "key_npcs": "Minister Alan Greener is the gatekeeper - fair but firm, he offers a deal and expects it honored. Dictator Masterton appears only in crisis, decisive and practical. The customs officer and bartender hold pieces of the puzzle about the previous crew. Captain Corelli provides transport. The unnamed Vargr chauffeur becomes unexpectedly heroic.",

    "locations": "Flammarion (start), 567-908 (waypoint), Walston Starport, Startown (the Dusty Airlock bar), Government Building (Greener's office), the mountain route, the Highndry crash site, Mount Salbarii, the coastal town of Barvinn, Salbarii command post.",

    "story_beats_reference": "Key moments: departure from Flammarion, arrival at 567-908, arrival at Walston, meeting Greener, exploring Startown, journey to ship, discovering Highndry, Tensher's Wolf encounter, volcano survey, eruption begins, crisis response, Barvinn rescue, chauffeur rescue choice, resolution."

    "The far trader drops out of jump, and Walston hangs in the void ahead - small, brown, unremarkable. Somewhere down there, a ship waits. Your ship, if you can claim it.",
    "Greener studies you across his desk. He's seen spacers before - some honest, some not. The question is which kind you are. The deal he offers is fair. Whether you honor it remains to be seen.",
    "The mountain trembles. What seemed like routine survey work has become something else entirely. Mount Salbarii is waking, and you are very, very close.",
    "Eleven people at Barvinn. Three in a downed limo. The Highndry can reach one group. Masterton's voice crackles over the radio, waiting for your answer. There is no good choice here - only the choice you can live with."
