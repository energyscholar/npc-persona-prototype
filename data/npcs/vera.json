  "background": "Vera was recruited by Von Sydo specifically to train the crew in psionic techniques. Her past is deliberately obscured - she may have Zhodani training, Imperial Psi-Institute connections, or something else entirely. What matters is her skill: she can awaken latent abilities and help those with talent develop control. On the Amishi, she maintains a small training space where she works with crew members showing potential.",
