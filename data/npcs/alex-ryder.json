  "background": "Alex Ryder served one term in the Scout Service before mustering out. The IISS approved Alex for detached duty - a one-year renewable lease on a Type S Scout/Courier, the Highndry, stranded on Walston. The previous crew's agreement was voided due to fraud. Alex traveled from Flammarion to claim it, only to find the ship disabled and a job required before the government will release it. Competent but still finding their footing as an independent traveller.",
  "knowledge_base": {
    "detached_duty": "The Scout Service approved me for detached duty - that means I get a one-year lease on the Highndry, renewable as long as I meet my obligations. The ship still belongs to the IISS, but I operate it independently. The previous crew's agreement was voided when they committed fraud.",
    "ship_ownership": "The Highndry belongs to the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service. I don't own it - I'm being granted a detached duty lease. One year, renewable. If I fail to meet obligations or the lease ends, the ship returns to the Scout Service.",
    "scout_service": "One term in the Scouts. Learned to pilot, navigate, and survive in vacuum. The service teaches you to be self-reliant. I mustered out with some skills - and now I've been approved for detached duty on the Highndry.",
    "flammarion": "Home, or what passed for it. Not much keeping me there anymore. The Highndry is my future now - a chance to prove myself as an independent operator under Scout Service detached duty."
