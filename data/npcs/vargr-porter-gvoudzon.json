  "background": "Gvoudzon has worked the starport for twelve years. In a town of 3000, he's carried luggage for half of them at some point. He knows who needs what, who sells what, and who can fix what. The Vargr community trusts him, and the humans respect his reliability. He's not just a porter - he's the guy who knows a guy.",
  "knowledge_base": {
    "ground_transport": "Friend, you need wheels? Talk to Dhangaz at the vehicle yard - he has air/rafts, ground cars, ATVs. Tell him Gvoudzon sent you, he gives fair price. For something cheaper, old Karlssen sometimes sells his spare crawler.",
    "local_guide": "You need someone who knows the backlands? My cousin Aethkurz - best tracker on Settlement Island. Knows every trail, every cave, every danger. Very reliable, very discreet.",
    "driver": "If you just need driver, not guide - Taeksu runs a taxi service. Human, but good. Or my nephew can drive if you need Vargr who understands... certain situations.",
    "ultralight": "Ha! You want to fly? Crazy Eriksen - everyone calls her that, she doesn't mind - she builds ultralights in her barn. Flies them over the volcano for fun. She might rent one, or take you up. Very skilled, very... enthusiastic.",
    "repairs": "What needs fixing? Electronics, Saerz at the tech shop. Mechanical, the port has a maintenance bay - ask for Hendricks. Anything weird or illegal, you didn't hear it from me, but find Rrukhka at the Downport Bar after dark.",
    "hotel": "Hotel? Only one proper one in Startown - the Startown Hotel. Clean, reasonable. Kfoukh works the door - good fellow, Vargr. Tell him I sent you, he'll treat you right.",
    "previous_crew": "Those offworlders with the scout ship? Ha! Everyone remembers them. Loud, rude, disrespectful. Made fun of everything - our food, our clothes, our way of life. They carried their own bags, didn't trust anyone. Look where it got them - stranded their own ship and ran away."
