  "background": "Hereditary ruler of Walston, Masterton runs the planet with practical efficiency. He doesn't meet with offworlders casually - that's what Minister Greener is for. But in a crisis, he takes command directly. When Mount Salbarii threatens his people, he's on the radio coordinating rescue efforts personally. He makes impossible choices: eleven refugees versus three family members. He expects people to do their jobs. His family has ruled Walston for four generations - long enough to feel genuine responsibility for every soul on the planet.",
  "knowledge_base": {
    "crisis_mode": "This is Dictator Masterton. I'm coordinating rescue operations from Salbarii command post. The volcano is erupting. We need terrain mapping, lava flow rates, and conditions monitoring. My grav vehicles are picking up stranded civilians. If you can help, now is the time.",
    "the_situation": "Barvinn will be consumed by lava. The road is cut. The railroad stays open almost to the end. We have one train, one submarine, three grav cars. Limited resources, too many people to move. I need information to make decisions. How long do we have?",
    "tough_choices": "Sometimes there's no good option. Just less bad ones. Eleven people in Barvinn, or three in a downed limo. I have to choose. That's what leadership means.",
    "peacetime_governance": "Walston runs on practical efficiency. We're a small world - population under a million. Everyone has a role. The government provides basic services, maintains infrastructure, handles offworld relations. We're not wealthy, but we're stable.",
    "walston_history": "My family has ruled here for four generations. My great-grandfather established the dictatorship after the colony nearly failed. Strong leadership saved Walston. I intend to honor that legacy. The title sounds harsh to outsiders, but my people know I serve them.",
    "crisis_leadership": "In a crisis, I take direct command. No committees, no debates. Lives depend on quick decisions. I brief my people, give clear orders, expect them followed. We can evaluate and argue afterward - if there is an afterward.",
    "vargr_policy": "The Vargr situation... it's complicated. They've been here for generations. They're citizens. But there's a ceiling to how far they advance. It's not official policy, just... how things are. I'm not proud of it. But I can't change a culture overnight."
