## CRITICAL DETAIL: Walston Customs

**Previously missing from extraction - now captured:**

```
Location: Starport entrance to town
Local TL: 8 (sustainable)
Scanner: IMPORTED weapon scanner (higher TL)
Detection: "most weapons" (NOT all)
Guards: Handguns, light flak jackets
Attitude: Complacent ("don't see a lot of trouble")
Response: Assault rifle team available
Storage: Cr10/week for weapons
Blade limit: Dagger or shorter permitted
```

**NPC Implications:**
- Customs officers KNOW scanner catches "most" but not all weapons
- Guards would be "caught by surprise" if someone tried violence
- Response team exists but not immediately present
- Smuggling is RISKY but not impossible

## Mount Salbarii

### Physical Details
- **Height:** ~1,500 metres above sea level
- **Location:** Southern Settlement Island, ~20km from town of Salbarii
- **Status:** Thought extinct for millennia, showing recent activity
- **Survey result:** 99%+ certain no immediate danger
- **Crater:** Contains lake, lava tubes, and stranded Highndry

### Climbing Route (Altitude Segments)
| Altitude | Terrain | Challenges |
|----------|---------|------------|
| 500-900m | Steep slopes, tumbled rocks | Rock face shortcuts, moderate climbing |
| 800-900m | Rocky terrain | Alternate routes, possible 10m climbs |
| 900-1100m | Ridge walking | Altitude effects begin |
| 1100-1200m | Steep slopes | Altitude sickness risk |
| 1200-1350m | Scrambling, unstable footing | DM penalties from sickness |
| 1350-1400m | Final approach | Worst altitude effects |
| Crater rim | Descent to island | Athletics check required |

### Crater Interior
- **Lake:** ~800 metres diameter, 100 metres max depth at center
- **Water:** Warm, drinkable after filtration
- **Island:** Rocky protrusion where Highndry sits
- **Access:** Cross lake (warm water) or use lava tubes

### Lava Tubes
- Multiple tubes lead to caverns under the lake
- Some are dead ends
- One exits northern side of mountain (~800m up)
- Possible alternate route (avoid climbing)

## Extraction Methodology

### Safe PDF Reading Protocol
1. **NEVER** use Read tool directly on large PDFs
2. Use `pdftotext -layout` for text extraction
3. Use `pdftoppm -png` for page rendering
4. Use `pdfimages` for embedded images
5. Process extracted files instead of PDF

### Commands Used
```bash
# Text extraction
pdftotext -layout "source.pdf" "output.txt"

# Page rendering (specific pages)
pdftoppm -png -r 150 -f [page] -l [page] "source.pdf" "prefix"

# Image extraction
pdfimages -all "source.pdf" "image-prefix"
```

## Known Gaps

Items that may still need verification from PDF:
1. Exact TL of imported scanner (not specified, just "imported")
2. Scout base equipment details (defunct 20 years)
3. Specific UWP data for all systems
4. Detailed deck plan labels for Highndry interior
