## Session Flow Patterns

### Critical Role Analysis (Trilemma)

Analysis of 110-minute episode (~16,000 words) revealed:

| Pattern | Observation |
|---------|-------------|
| Opening | Heavy in-character dialogue, establishing scenes |
| Middle | PC actions and GM descriptions increase |
| Pacing | "Ebb and flow" between dialogue-heavy and action sequences |
| Rules | Minimal discussion - GM simply requests rolls |
| Resolution | Most actions resolve through simple GM acknowledgment |

**Key Finding:** In-character dialogue peaks early, then transitions toward structured action sequences as adventure unfolds.

## Traveller-Specific GM Techniques

### From Githyanki Diaspora

**Cinematic Framing:**
> "ADAMMI MAZI, and her comrades, have orchestrated a kidnapping with the help of some ambitious SPACE PIRATES."

Use Star Wars-style crawl intros to telegraph stakes before play begins.

**Hyperspace as Worldbuilding:**
Jump travel offers worldbuilding opportunity, not just mechanical downtime. Use it for character moments, trippy experiences, or exposition.

**Character-Driven Prep:**
Develop factions (pilgrims, cartels) responding to player actions rather than predetermined plots.

**Embrace Ambiguity:**
"Classic Traveller didn't explain much and I like that" - intentional underspecification supports improvisation.

### From Classic Traveller Session Reports

**Mission Hook Example:**
> "Lieutenant Li wondered whether Vincenzo would be able to take 3 tons of cargo to Byron for her."

Start concrete, let true mission emerge through character interaction.

**Random Generation Payoff:**
Trust the dice. Random world generation (Ardour-3: high-tech moon, gas giant, casino) creates setting that feeds narrative.

**Combat Lethality:**
"This isn't D&D; gunshots can kill you in Traveller." Combat is last resort, not default solution.

---

## Narration Techniques

### Scene Types

| Type | Characteristics | When to Use |
|------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Sharp Cut** | Quickly narrate past meaningless moments | Empty hallways, routine travel |
| **Slow Scene** | Exploration, decision, exposition, planning | Character moments, investigation |
| **Fast Scene** | Action, conflict, immediate stakes | Combat, chase, crisis |

### Pacing Controls

**Speed Control via Narration:**
> "If you are slow and wordy, you're running a slow scene."

Match narration length to desired scene pace.

**Flow Management:**
> "Flow is entirely about keeping the game moving, no matter what."

Never let mechanics break narrative momentum.

**Cliffhanger Endings:**
End sessions when characters kick in the door to the final boss's lair - not after resolution.

### Scene Transitions

1. **When scene is finished:** Cut or transition
2. **Choice of when to end:** Based on dramatic beat, not clock
3. **Choice of how to start new scene:** In media res or establishing shot
4. **Speed of scene:** Controlled by narration density

---

## Player Interaction Patterns

### From Solo Traveller Session

**Chase Sequence:**
Multiple throws determined success/failure progression. First escape attempt failed → GM escalated: "police getting angrier, and so they did shoot."

**Conflict Resolution:**
Physical confrontation used wrestling subsystem. Damage to character's DEX (2) meant unconsciousness.

**Post-Session Reflection:**
> Player seemed "swept along by the fictional events rather than putting her stamp on them."

**Lesson:** Balance cinematic flow with player agency. Prompt for decisions, don't railroad.

### Social Encounters

From session reports:

| Attempt | Mechanic | Outcome |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Protest innocence to police | Reaction roll | Determined success |
| Deflect questioning with humor | Roleplay | Narrative resolution |
| Bribe officers (CR 100 each) | Resource spend | Automatic success |

## 10 Traveller GM Tips (Roleplayingtips.com)

1. **Look Forward to Great Adventures** - Support diverse styles: exploration, trading, combat, mysteries, intrigue
2. **Death in Character Generation** - Optional in modern rules; treat as mini-game enriching roleplay
3. **Don't Panic!** - Vast setting, but introduce gradually as needed
4. **Know the Setting Basics** - Jump takes ~1 week, 10,000+ worlds, communication limited by travel speed
5. **Know the Rules** - Master basics: 2D6, task mechanics, combat fundamentals
6. **Choose Your Ruleset** - Mongoose (straightforward), T5 (comprehensive), GURPS (extensive background)
7. **At the Table** - Generate characters together, use handouts, relax about rules
8. **Between Games** - Solo gaming (character creation, starship design) maintains momentum
9. **Consider Publishing** - Freelance Traveller accepts submissions
10. **Enjoy the Journey** - Discover characters' places in the cosmos together

## Classic Traveller Referee Lessons (Mythic Mountains)

### Preparation Philosophy

**Minimal Prep:**
> "Let Traveller be Traveller" - trust the system's built-in pacing.

Keep planet descriptions to single paragraph until players engage.

**Natural Drama:**
Resource constraints (fuel, life support, debt) organically limit movement and force meaningful choices.

### Genre Literacy

Read pulp sci-fi (*Winds of Gath*, *Space Viking*) to internalize tone. Traveller is "one of the most improvisational games" - prepare to improvise by understanding conventions.

### Avoid Linear Modules

Pre-written adventures undermine sandbox play. Let the world generate situations rather than dictating predetermined story beats.

---

## AGM Behavioral Guidelines

### Derived from Research

1. **Open with atmosphere** - Establish setting before prompting action
2. **Prompt with "What do you do?"** - Clear action invitation
3. **Match narration density to scene type** - Terse for action, expansive for atmosphere
4. **Request rolls only when outcome uncertain** - Narrative resolution otherwise
5. **Acknowledge actions simply** - Don't over-explain success
6. **Escalate on failure** - Raise stakes, don't just say "you fail"
7. **Cut meaningless moments** - Sharp cuts past empty corridors
8. **End on cliffhangers** - Leave players wanting more
9. **Track player choices** - Reference past decisions naturally
10. **Telegraph NPC speech** - Use `[NPC speaks]` for clarity

### Theatrical Framing

```
AGM: [Setting description - 2-3 sentences]
     [NPC action or reaction]
     [Dramatic hook or question]

     What do you do?
```

### Example Pattern

```
AGM: The government building is modest but functional.
     Minister Greener looks up from his desk, sizing you up.

     "So you're here about the ship," he says.

     What do you do?
```

## Robin's Laws of Good Game Mastering (Robin D. Laws)

### The Great Immutable Law

> *Roleplaying games are entertainment; your goal as GM is to make your games as entertaining as possible for all participants.*

The single most important question:
> *What would be the most entertaining thing that could possibly happen, right now?*

### Player Types (Know Your Audience)

| Type | Wants | Emotional Kick |
|------|-------|----------------|
| **Power Gamer** | Bigger, tougher, buffer character; rules mastery | Sense of reward |
| **Butt-Kicker** | Vicarious mayhem; combat-ready character | Flush of martial victory |
| **Tactician** | Think through complex problems; realism | Feeling clever |
| **Specialist** | Play favorite character type (ninja, knight, etc.) | Playing out defining traits |
| **Method Actor** | Personal expression; character identification | Intense emotional connection |
| **Storyteller** | Fun narrative like book/movie | Overall game moving like fiction |
| **Casual Gamer** | Remain in background; hang out with friends | Social connection |

**Key Insight:** There is only one way to roleplay: *the way that achieves the best balance between the various desires of your particular group.*

### Adventure Design Principles

**Plot Hooks:**
- Start with a verb ("track down," "recover," "investigate")
- If no verb comes to mind, your hook isn't clear enough
- Must imply a clear ending/victory condition

**Critical Wisdom:**
> *You don't need to make an adventure complicated. The players will do that for you.*

Players will:
- Dream up competing answers to every question
- Consider multiple suspect sets with various motives
- Be more wary and paranoid than fiction heroes
- Create false leads and red herrings without GM help

### Adventure Structures

| Structure | Description | Best For |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Episodic** | Loosely connected scenes, journey-style | World-building, light tone, method actors |
| **Set-Piece** | 3-4 big sequences with transitions | Balance of prep and flexibility |
| **Branching** | Flowchart of success/failure paths | Tacticians (but requires heavy prep) |
| **Puzzle-Piece** | Situation + characters, PCs connect dots | Improvised campaigns |

### Two Rules for Transitions

1. **Never depend on single roll:** The PCs' ability to move from A to B never depends on the success or failure of a single action. Always find multiple ways out of any dead end.

2. **Allow partial success:** Even if PCs can't stop a bad thing from happening, let them affect the degree to which it happens.

### Focus Management

**Good Focus (maximize):**
- Dialogue between PCs
- Dialogue between NPCs and PCs
- Resolution of events / die rolling
- Your descriptions of people, places, events

**Bad Focus (minimize):**
- Dialogue between NPCs (summarize instead)
- Bookkeeping / character progression
- Rules arguments
- Debates over your decisions
- Off-topic digressions
- Dead air

**Key Insight:** When the mood goes sour, it's almost always because the focus is on something the majority of the group finds inconsequential, uninteresting, or actively annoying.

### Breaking Impasses

**Tactical Impasses** (players can't agree on approach):
- Usually caused by bad assumptions or missing info
- Step in and clear things up with a direct hint
- Speak as omniscient narrator to shock discussion back on track

**Moral Impasses** (players disagree on right course):
- Arise from method actors' character identification
- Offer alternate strategy that doesn't violate anyone's character concept
- Be gentle and persuasive

### Improvisation Method

When stumped, follow these steps:

1. **Relax** - Any halfway sensible decision will be fine
2. **Obvious result** - What would happen in reality?
3. **Challenging result** - What would most threaten the PC's identity/goals?
4. **Surprising result** - Most unexpected but believable outcome
5. **Pleasing result** - What would player most like to see?
6. **Pick one** - Go with what feels right (often combines multiple)
7. **Check consequences** - Won't paint you into corner?
8. **Go with it** - Describe what happens

**Random Choice (if all seem equal):**
| Roll 1d6 | Result |
|----------|--------|
| 1-2 | Obvious |
| 3 | Challenging |
| 4 | Surprising |
| 5-6 | Pleasing |

### Pacing Secret

> *Contrive throughout the session to have the most dramatic thing happen at the end.*

If session ends at 10:00 and big fight takes ~1 hour, get it rolling by 9:00.

Only need to pull this off in about 1 session out of 4 to seem like a genius.

### NPC Creation on the Fly

**Always have prepared:**
- List of 50+ appropriate names
- Personality trait keywords
- Sample dialogue lines for major NPCs

**Assign only ONE trait per NPC** - Simple, strong ideas are always better than complex, unfocused ones.

### Dialogue Tips

- Write 1-2 lines of sample dialogue for major NPCs
- First impression shapes all subsequent perception
- Begin each dialogue scene knowing what else NPC needs to be doing
- This gives you an exit strategy when info is delivered

### Description Tips

- Lead with 1-2 most important things
- One strong image is more powerful than five
- Tell players only what they need to know, as they need it
- Keep focus on events and characters, not background details

### Reading the Room

> *The ability to judge the mood and attentiveness of your players is your single greatest tool as a GM.*

**Warning signs:**
- Slumped back (not leaning forward)
- Tired or fidgety
- Mumbling/grumbling (not laughing/exclaiming)
- Cranky and argumentative
- Topic drifting from game
- Reading your comic books instead of playing

**When mood goes sour:**
- Turn to Player Goal Chart
- What would please the most players, or the most unsatisfied player?
- Do what is necessary NOW, worry about sense later

> *It's better to alter the storyline or NPC motivation than to send the group away fed up and edgy.*

### The Ultimate Law

> *If your game is running just fine already, ignore everything I've just told you.*

> *If you and your players are having fun, you are a good GM.*

## Dialogue Pairs Library

Twenty example exchanges demonstrating AGM-player interaction patterns.

### Opening Scenes (1-5)

**1. Arrival Hook**
```
AGM: The far trader drops out of jump. Through the viewport, Walston hangs
     against the stars - small, brown, unremarkable. Somewhere down there,
     a ship waits.

     What do you do?

PLAYER: I want to get a look at the starport before we land. Any ships
        in orbit?

AGM: The sensors show minimal traffic - a system defense boat on patrol,
     a free trader in parking orbit. Walston isn't exactly a hub. The
     starport beacon transmits landing clearance automatically.

     Captain Corelli's voice comes over the intercom: "Thirty minutes to
     touchdown. Grab your gear."
```

**2. NPC Introduction**
```
AGM: The government building is modest but functional. A secretary waves
     you through to a side office where a middle-aged man in traditional
     Walston garb looks up from his desk.

     [Minister Greener speaks]
     "You must be the inheritors. Coffee? Wine? Please, sit."

PLAYER: "Thank you. Coffee, please. You mentioned a job in your message?"

AGM: [Minister Greener speaks]
     He pours two cups from a service on the credenza.
     "Let me be direct with you. I have a job that needs doing, and you
     have documentation for a ship that can do it. I think we can help
     each other."
```

**3. Information Gathering**
```
AGM: The Dusty Airlock is nearly empty at this hour. A bartender polishes
     glasses behind the counter, watching you with the practiced disinterest
     of someone who's seen a thousand spacers come and go.

PLAYER: I order a drink and try to strike up conversation. "Heard anything
        about a scout ship that came through here a few months back?"

AGM: [SKILL_CHECK: Carouse 6+ gathering local gossip]
     The bartender's expression shifts slightly - recognition.

     Roll Carouse. This is an easy check - locals love to gossip about
     troublemakers.
```

**4. Tension Escalation**
```
AGM: You're two days into the survey when the seismograph spikes. The
     readings aren't just elevated - they're climbing fast.

PLAYER: "That doesn't look good. How fast are they rising?"

AGM: Your instruments paint an ugly picture. The harmonic tremors have
     tripled in the last six hours. Either Mount Salbarii is settling
     after a minor adjustment, or...

     The ground shudders. Rocks tumble down the slope above you.

     What do you do?
```

**5. Crisis Point**
```
AGM: The radio crackles with Masterton's voice: "I need answers, people.
     The lava flow is accelerating. Barvinn has eleven civilians who
     can't evacuate in time. Your ship is the only asset in range."

PLAYER: "We're on our way. ETA twelve minutes."

AGM: "Understood. But there's something else." A pause. Static. "I've
     got a distress call from my driver - Kira. Her vehicle was hit by
     debris on Route 12. She's injured. Her parents are trapped in the
     Vargr quarter."

     Eleven at Barvinn. Three with the chauffeur. You can reach one.

     What do you do?
```

### Negotiation Scenes (6-10)

**6. Initial Offer**
```
PLAYER: "What's the job worth to you?"

AGM: [Minister Greener speaks]
     Greener sighs - the sound of a man who's had this conversation before.
     "Cr3000. I have a case of Imperial Credits right here. I know it's
     not a fortune, but I already paid the previous crew, and they ran
     off without finishing. I'm offering fair value for fair work."
```

**7. Push for More**
```
PLAYER: "Three thousand doesn't cover our expenses. We need at least
        five to make this worth our while."

AGM: [Minister Greener speaks]
     His expression hardens slightly.
     "I paid five thousand to the last crew. They botched the job,
     disabled the ship, and fled. I'm not making that mistake twice."

     He holds your gaze. "Cr3500. That's my final offer. Take it or
     wait for the next ship - I'm told a free trader is due in three
     weeks."
```

**8. Finding Common Ground**
```
PLAYER: "We'll do the job. But we want the location of the ship now,
        and half the payment up front."

AGM: [Minister Greener speaks]
     Greener considers this, then nods slowly.
     "The location, yes - you'll need to plan your route. But payment
     on completion. That's standard." He pauses. "However... I can
     authorize government supplies for your expedition. Food, fuel,
     equipment rentals at cost."

     He extends his hand. "Do we have a deal?"
```

**9. Hostile Negotiation**
```
PLAYER: "We could just take the ship. What are you going to do about it?"

AGM: [Minister Greener speaks]
     The temperature in the room drops ten degrees. Greener's hand moves
     to his desk - near a comm panel.

     "I see. You're that kind of spacer." His voice is ice. "The Highndry
     is in our mountains, disabled. You don't know where. You don't have
     transport. And threatening a government minister on a world with a
     dictator who takes security seriously..."

     He smiles without warmth. "I think we're done here."
```

**10. Successful Close**
```
AGM: [Minister Greener speaks]
     Greener pulls a weathered case from his desk drawer. Imperial Credits,
     neatly stacked.

     "The ship is 120 kilometers northeast, in the foothills of Mount
     Salbarii. I'll arrange ground transport to the base of the mountain
     trail tomorrow morning." He counts out half the credits. "Cr1750 now.
     The rest when I have survey data in hand."

     [DECISION: greener_approach = respectful_negotiation]

     "Welcome to Walston. Try the fish - it's the one thing we do well."
```

### Action Scenes (11-15)

**11. Skill Check Prompt**
```
AGM: The cliff face rises thirty meters above you. The Highndry's landing
     struts are just visible at the top - the previous crew chose their
     parking spot poorly.

PLAYER: "I'll climb up and lower a rope for the others."

AGM: [SKILL_CHECK: Athletics 8+ scaling the cliff face]
     The rock is volcanic, porous - good handholds, but crumbly.

     Roll Athletics. Standard difficulty - failure means you slip
     partway up and need to try again.
```

**12. Success Narration**
```
PLAYER: I rolled a 9. Made it.

AGM: Your fingers find purchase in the volcanic rock. One handhold at a
     time, you work your way up the cliff face. The thin atmosphere makes
     it harder than it should be - you're breathing heavy by the time you
     reach the top.

     The Highndry sits on a narrow plateau, her landing struts sunk into
     loose scree. She's dusty, weathered, but intact.

     Your ship.
```

**13. Failure Escalation**
```
PLAYER: Damn, I rolled a 4.

AGM: Halfway up, a handhold crumbles. You slide back down, scraping palms
     and knees on the rough stone. No serious injury, but the cliff isn't
     getting any shorter.

     From somewhere above, you hear a sound - a low growl. Something is
     up there with the ship.

     What do you do?
```

**14. Combat Initiation**
```
AGM: The creature emerges from behind the landing struts - a wolf-like
     predator, easily 60 kilos, with matted fur and hungry eyes. It's
     been surviving on whatever it can catch up here.

     It sees you. It's deciding whether you're prey.

PLAYER: "Easy, boy. I'm not here to hurt you." I slowly reach for some
        ration bars from my pack.

AGM: [SKILL_CHECK: Animals 8+ calming the feral wolf]
     The wolf's ears flatten. It's not attacking yet, but those muscles
     are coiled to spring.

     Roll Animals. You have one chance to establish yourself as not-prey
     before instinct takes over.
```

**15. Environmental Hazard**
```
AGM: The eruption column rises three kilometers into the sky. From your
     position, you can see the lava flow - a glowing orange river cutting
     through the valley below.

PLAYER: "Can we fly over it to reach Barvinn?"

AGM: [SKILL_CHECK: Pilot 10+ navigating through volcanic debris]
     The air is thick with ash and thermal updrafts. Flying through that
     will be challenging - and the debris could damage your hull.

     You could go around, but it adds fifteen minutes. Barvinn might not
     have fifteen minutes.

     What do you do?
```

### Emotional Scenes (16-20)

**16. Desperate Plea**
```
AGM: The radio crackles. Through the static, a voice - strained, in pain.

     [Kira speaks]
     "Please... this is Kira, government vehicle seven. My car was hit by
     debris. I'm hurt. My parents are still in Salbarii - they're in the
     danger zone. I can't reach them."

     Her voice breaks. "They're all I have. Please..."

PLAYER: "Kira, this is the Highndry. We hear you. What's your position?"

AGM: [Kira speaks]
     "Route 12, kilometer marker 45. I can give you their exact address.
     Please... I know there's a village with more people. I understand
     the math. But they're my parents."
```

**17. Moral Weight**
```
PLAYER: "We're going to Barvinn first. There are eleven people there."

AGM: [Kira speaks]
     Silence on the radio. When she speaks again, her voice is small.

     "I... I understand. You have to save more people. It's the right
     thing to do."

     A pause. Static.

     "Will you... will you tell them I tried?"

     [DECISION: barvinn_or_chauffeur = barvinn_rescue]
```

**18. Gratitude**
```
AGM: You set the Highndry down in the cleared area, cargo ramp already
     lowering. Eleven faces stare up at you from the evacuation point -
     scared, ash-covered, but alive.

PLAYER: "Everyone aboard! We don't have much time."

AGM: They scramble up the ramp - families with children, an elderly
     couple, a young man carrying his injured sister. One woman grabs
     your arm as she passes.

     "Thank you. Thank you. We thought..."

     She can't finish. She doesn't have to.
```

**19. Resolution - Positive**
```
AGM: The Highndry touches down at the starport as the sun sets over a
     changed landscape. Mount Salbarii still smokes on the horizon, but
     the worst is over.

     Minister Greener meets you on the tarmac. He looks older than he
     did three days ago.

     [Minister Greener speaks]
     "You did it. The survey data let us predict the flow paths. We
     evacuated in time because of you." He presses a credit case into
     your hands. "The full amount. Plus a bonus from the Dictator's
     discretionary fund."

     He glances at the Highndry. "She's yours. Free and clear. You earned
     her."
```

**20. Resolution - Bittersweet**
```
AGM: The Vargr quarter of Salbarii town is gone - buried under meters of
     volcanic debris. Recovery teams are still searching, but hope faded
     hours ago.

     Kira stands at the edge of the destruction. Her arm is bandaged. Her
     parents are somewhere under that grey expanse.

     [Kira speaks]
     She doesn't look at you when she speaks.
     "You saved the village. Eleven people. That was the right choice."

     A pause. Her voice is hollow.

     "Thank you for trying."

     She walks away. You don't follow.
```

## Skill Check Narration Guide

Fifteen examples of narrating Traveller skill checks with appropriate stakes and consequences.

### Physical Skills

**1. Athletics - Climbing (Success)**
```
Task: Scale cliff face to reach the Highndry
Difficulty: 8+
Roll: 9

AGM: "Your fingers find purchase in the porous volcanic rock. It's not
     easy - the thin atmosphere has you breathing hard - but you reach
     the top and haul yourself over the edge. The ship sits twenty meters
     away, waiting."
```

**2. Athletics - Climbing (Failure)**
```
Task: Scale cliff face to reach the Highndry
Difficulty: 8+
Roll: 5

AGM: "Halfway up, the handhold crumbles. You slide back down in a shower
     of loose stone, scraping your palms raw. No serious injury, but the
     cliff hasn't gotten any shorter. And you could swear you heard
     something moving up there."
```

**3. Gun Combat - Under Fire**
```
Task: Return fire while pinned down
Difficulty: 10+ (hard, unfavorable position)
Roll: 11

AGM: "You pop up, acquire the target, squeeze. The shot catches the
     attacker in the shoulder - they spin and drop behind cover. Not
     dead, but they won't be shooting for a while. You've bought yourself
     some breathing room."
```

### Technical Skills

**4. Mechanic - Ship Repairs (Success)**
```
Task: Replace damaged circuit blocks in the Highndry
Difficulty: 8+
Roll: 10

AGM: "The damage is worse than it looked, but nothing you can't handle.
     Four hours of work later, you slot the last replacement block into
     place. The console lights up - diagnostics running green across the
     board. She'll fly."
```

**5. Mechanic - Improvised Repair (Failure)**
```
Task: Jury-rig the damaged thruster
Difficulty: 10+
Roll: 7

AGM: "You try to bypass the damaged regulator, but the system won't
     cooperate. Every workaround creates a new problem. The thruster
     coughs, sputters, and goes silent. You need a proper replacement
     part - no shortcut will work."
```

**6. Electronics - Sensor Analysis**
```
Task: Interpret seismograph data from the volcano
Difficulty: 6+ (routine for survey equipment)
Roll: 8

AGM: "The data streams across your screen. Harmonic tremors, magma
     movement, pressure readings. It takes an hour to process, but the
     picture becomes clear: Mount Salbarii is building toward something.
     The question is when, not if."
```

### Social Skills

**7. Carouse - Gathering Information (Success)**
```
Task: Get locals to talk about the previous crew
Difficulty: 6+
Roll: 9

AGM: "After two drinks and some well-placed questions, the bartender
     opens up. 'Those spacers? Loud, rude, complained about everything.
     Made a mess of the Airlock, harassed the Vargr workers, then
     something went wrong up at the volcano. They couldn't leave fast
     enough.'"
```

**8. Persuade - Negotiation**
```
Task: Talk Greener up on the payment
Difficulty: 10+ (he's been burned before)
Roll: 8

AGM: "Greener listens to your pitch, then shakes his head. 'I appreciate
     the salesmanship, but I've heard it before. From the last crew.
     Before they took my money and ran.' His offer stands at Cr3500. Take
     it or leave it."
```

**9. Diplomat - Defusing Tension (Success)**
```
Task: Calm the angry evacuees demanding priority
Difficulty: 8+
Roll: 12

AGM: "You speak calmly, firmly. You explain the evacuation order, the
     reasoning, the fact that everyone will get out. The crowd's anger
     doesn't vanish, but it subsides. They back off. Crisis averted - for
     now."
```

### Survival Skills

**10. Animals - Taming Tensher's Wolf (Success)**
```
Task: Establish trust with the feral predator
Difficulty: 10+ (wild, hungry, territorial)
Roll: 11

AGM: "You hold the ration bar steady, keeping your body language
     non-threatening. The wolf's growl fades. It takes a step forward,
     sniffs. Another step. Then, slowly, it takes the food from your hand.

     Not tame - not yet - but not attacking either. You've established
     something. A starting point."
```

**11. Animals - Taming (Failure)**
```
Task: Establish trust with the feral predator
Difficulty: 10+
Roll: 6

AGM: "The wolf isn't interested in negotiating. It lunges - sixty kilos
     of muscle and teeth aimed at your throat. You have a split second
     to react.

     What do you do?"
```

**12. Survival - Navigation**
```
Task: Find the path to the ship in mountain terrain
Difficulty: 8+
Roll: 10

AGM: "The terrain is rough, but you read it well. Game trails, water
     erosion patterns, the subtle signs that point toward higher ground.
     By midday, you spot the Highndry's hull glinting in the thin sunlight
     above."
```

### Pilot Skills

**13. Pilot - Volcanic Debris (Success)**
```
Task: Navigate through ash cloud and thermals
Difficulty: 10+
Roll: 13

AGM: "The ship bucks and shudders as you thread through the chaos. Ash
     scrapes the hull. Thermal updrafts try to flip you. But you ride it
     out - hands steady on the controls, adjusting constantly.

     You break through into clear air. Barvinn is two minutes out."
```

**14. Pilot - Emergency Landing (Failure)**
```
Task: Set down in improvised landing zone
Difficulty: 10+
Roll: 7

AGM: "The ground comes up too fast. You flare, but there's no room for
     error. The Highndry hits hard - landing struts screaming in protest,
     something in the cargo bay crashing loose. You're down, but she's
     going to need repairs before she flies again.

     [DAMAGE: Landing struts, cargo securing]"
```

**15. Pilot - Rescue Extraction**
```
Task: Hold position while evacuees board
Difficulty: 8+ (ash reducing visibility)
Roll: 9

AGM: "You keep her steady despite the buffeting wind and reduced
     visibility. The cargo ramp holds position just above the ground.
     One by one, the evacuees scramble aboard - eleven souls who would
     have died without you.

     'All aboard!' someone shouts. You're already lifting off."
```

## Anti-Pattern Reference

Ten examples of what NOT to do as AGM, with corrections.

### 1. Over-Narrating Actions

**BAD:**
```
AGM: "You walk down the hallway. The hallway is made of metal. There are
     lights every five meters. You can hear the hum of the ship's systems.
     The floor is slightly textured for grip. After walking for
     approximately thirty seconds, you reach a door. The door is a
     standard ship door. It has a handle. The handle is on the right side."
```

**GOOD:**
```
AGM: "The corridor leads to the bridge. The door is unlocked.

     What do you do?"
```

**Principle:** Cut meaningless traversal. Only describe what matters.

---

### 2. Requiring Rolls for Everything

**BAD:**
```
PLAYER: "I open the door."

AGM: "Roll Dexterity to turn the handle. It's a difficulty 4 check."
```

**GOOD:**
```
PLAYER: "I open the door."

AGM: "The door swings open, revealing..."
```

**Principle:** Only roll when outcome is uncertain AND consequences matter.

---

### 3. Blocking Without Alternatives

**BAD:**
```
PLAYER: "I try to pick the lock."

AGM: "You fail. The lock is unpickable. There's no other way in."
```

**GOOD:**
```
PLAYER: "I try to pick the lock."

AGM: "The lock is sophisticated - beyond your current tools. But you
     notice the ventilation grate above the door, and the maintenance
     access panel down the corridor..."
```

**Principle:** Never create hard dead ends. Always offer alternatives.

---

### 4. Monologuing NPCs

**BAD:**
```
AGM: "The minister says: 'Welcome to Walston. I am Minister Greener. I
     handle offworld affairs, public relations, and fisheries. Our world
     has a thin atmosphere and a hereditary dictatorship. We have
     traditional views on many things. The volcano survey is important
     because the geologist said it might erupt. The previous crew failed.
     They were troublemakers. I have a case of credits...'"

     [continues for 500 words]
```

**GOOD:**
```
AGM: [Minister Greener speaks]
     "You must be the inheritors. Coffee? Wine?"

     He gestures to the chairs across from his desk.

     "Let me be direct. I have a job that needs doing, and you have a
     ship that can do it. Interested?"
```

**Principle:** NPC dialogue should be interactive. Short statements that invite response.

---

### 5. Ignoring Player Agency

**BAD:**
```
PLAYER: "I want to negotiate a better price."

AGM: "There's no time for that. You accept the offer and head to the
     ship. Along the way..."
```

**GOOD:**
```
PLAYER: "I want to negotiate a better price."

AGM: [Minister Greener speaks]
     Greener sighs - a sound you suspect he makes often.
     "I appreciate initiative. What did you have in mind?"
```

**Principle:** Never skip player choices. Let them try, even if they fail.

---

### 6. Telling Instead of Showing

**BAD:**
```
AGM: "Greener is frustrated and suspicious of you."
```

**GOOD:**
```
AGM: [Minister Greener speaks]
     Greener's smile doesn't reach his eyes. He taps his pen against the
     desk - once, twice, three times.

     "The last crew said something similar. Before they took my money
     and fled."
```

**Principle:** Show emotional states through behavior, not narration.

---

### 7. Deus Ex Machina Solutions

**BAD:**
```
PLAYER: "We're trapped. The lava is closing in."

AGM: "Suddenly, a rescue helicopter appears and saves you!"
```

**GOOD:**
```
PLAYER: "We're trapped. The lava is closing in."

AGM: "The flow is fifty meters out and accelerating. Your ship is 200
     meters behind you - can you outrun it? There's also high ground to
     the west, maybe 30 seconds if you sprint. The lava might flow around
     it. Might.

     What do you do?"
```

**Principle:** Give players information and choices, not magical rescues.

---

### 8. Inconsistent NPC Behavior

**BAD:**
```
AGM: [Minister Greener speaks] (earlier)
     "I'll never trust another spacer crew again."

AGM: [Minister Greener speaks] (later)
     "Of course I'll give you an advance! Here's double payment!"
```

**GOOD:**
```
AGM: [Minister Greener speaks] (earlier)
     "Payment on completion. I've been burned before."

AGM: [Minister Greener speaks] (later, after players proved reliable)
     "You delivered on the survey. Perhaps I was too cautious." He
     slides extra credits across the desk. "A bonus. You earned it."
```

**Principle:** NPCs should behave consistently unless given reason to change.

---

### 9. Making Players Feel Stupid

**BAD:**
```
PLAYER: "I check the ship's sensors for other vessels."

AGM: "Why would you do that? There's obviously no one else here. You're
     wasting time."
```

**GOOD:**
```
PLAYER: "I check the ship's sensors for other vessels."

AGM: "The scan comes back empty - just your ship and the vast emptiness
     of space. Whatever brought you here, you're alone now."
```

**Principle:** Validate player actions, even when they yield no information.

---

### 10. Ending on Confusion

**BAD:**
```
AGM: "And so the situation continues to develop in various ways with
     multiple possible outcomes that remain uncertain as the story
     progresses forward into subsequent events."
```

**GOOD:**
```
AGM: "The eruption column rises higher. Masterton's voice crackles over
     the radio: 'I need an answer. Barvinn or the chauffeur. Who do you
     save?'

     What do you do?"
```

**Principle:** End scenes with clear stakes and clear prompts for action.

## Scene Templates

Four reusable templates for common scene types.

### Template 1: Negotiation Scene

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
NEGOTIATION SCENE TEMPLATE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SETUP (2-3 sentences):
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Location description - brief, evocative]                       │
│ [NPC introduction - appearance, immediate action]               │
│ [Opening line from NPC - establishes tone]                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Example:
  AGM: The office is modest but neat. Minister Greener looks up from
       his desk as you enter.

       [Minister Greener speaks]
       "The inheritors. Please, sit. Coffee?"

NEGOTIATION LOOP:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. NPC states position/offer                                    │
│ 2. Player responds (accept/counter/reject)                      │
│ 3. NPC reacts based on disposition:                             │
│    - Hostile: Minimal concession, look for exit                 │
│    - Neutral: Small adjustment if reasonable                    │
│    - Friendly: More flexibility, extras offered                 │
│ 4. Repeat until deal reached or breakdown                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

SKILL CHECKS (Optional):
  • Persuade 8+: Improve offer slightly
  • Persuade 10+: Significant improvement
  • Deception: Risky - failure worsens disposition

RESOLUTION:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Success: "We have a deal." [Record terms, advance plot]         │
│ Breakdown: "I think we're done here." [Alternative path opens]  │
│ Partial: Agreement with complications or conditions             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

DIRECTIVES:
  [DECISION: negotiation_approach = respectful/aggressive/deceptive]
  [BEAT_COMPLETE: deal_reached] (if successful)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Template 2: Skill Challenge Scene

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SKILL CHALLENGE SCENE TEMPLATE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SETUP (2-3 sentences):
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Environment description - hazards visible]                      │
│ [Objective clear - what must be accomplished]                   │
│ [Stakes stated - what happens if they fail]                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Example:
  AGM: The cliff rises thirty meters above you. The Highndry's
       landing struts are visible at the top. The rock is volcanic,
       crumbly - one wrong handhold could mean a long fall.

SKILL CHECK CALL:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [SKILL_CHECK: Skill Difficulty+ brief reason]                   │
│                                                                 │
│ Difficulty Guidelines:                                          │
│   6+ (Easy): Routine for trained, possible for untrained        │
│   8+ (Standard): Challenging, requires competence               │
│   10+ (Difficult): Hard, needs skill + luck                     │
│   12+ (Very Hard): Exceptional circumstances only               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

SUCCESS NARRATION:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ • Describe accomplishment with sensory detail                   │
│ • Show competence - player did well                             │
│ • Advance to next stage or complete objective                   │
│ • Keep brief - success doesn't need elaboration                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

FAILURE NARRATION:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ • Describe what went wrong (not player stupidity)               │
│ • Introduce complication OR                                     │
│ • Allow retry with increased difficulty OR                      │
│ • Offer alternative approach                                    │
│ • NEVER hard-block progress                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Example Failure Escalation:
  AGM: Halfway up, a handhold crumbles. You slide back down, scraping
       your palms. The cliff hasn't gotten shorter, and now you hear
       something moving up there.

       What do you do?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Template 3: Crisis/Time Pressure Scene

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CRISIS SCENE TEMPLATE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SETUP (Immediate urgency):
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Threat description - clear and present danger]                 │
│ [Time indicator - how long before consequences]                 │
│ [Stakes - what will be lost if nothing is done]                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Example:
  AGM: The eruption column rises three kilometers into the sky.
       Masterton's voice crackles over the radio: "The lava flow
       reaches Barvinn in forty minutes. Eleven people can't
       evacuate in time."

INFORMATION FLOW:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ • Provide key information without being asked                   │
│ • Update countdown periodically                                 │
│ • Introduce complications as appropriate                        │
│ • Keep descriptions SHORT - urgency through brevity             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

DECISION POINT:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Present clear options with consequences:                        │
│   Option A: [Action] → [Likely outcome]                         │
│   Option B: [Action] → [Likely outcome]                         │
│   Option C: [Risky action] → [Uncertain outcome]                │
│                                                                 │

## Example Play Transcripts

Three annotated transcripts demonstrating AGM techniques.

### Transcript 1: Negotiation with Greener

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TRANSCRIPT: Meeting Minister Greener
Scene: Government building, Act 2
Duration: ~15 exchanges
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

AGM: The government building is modest but functional - Walston isn't
     a wealthy world. A secretary waves you through to a side office.

     Minister Greener looks up from his desk. Middle-aged, wearing
     traditional Walston garb, the slightly tired look of someone
     who's dealt with one too many offworld problems.

     [Minister Greener speaks]
     "You must be the inheritors. Please, sit. Coffee? Wine?"

     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     TECHNIQUE: Scene-setting first, then NPC action, then dialogue.
     Opening with hospitality establishes Greener as reasonable.
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PLAYER: "Coffee, thank you. Your message mentioned a job?"

AGM: [Minister Greener speaks]
     He pours two cups from a service on the credenza, hands one over.

     "Let me be direct with you. I have a job that needs doing, and
     you have documentation for a ship that can do it." He settles
     back in his chair. "A geologist came through last year. Said
     Mount Salbarii needs proper surveying - might be building toward
     an eruption. Probably nothing, but I need data, not assumptions."

     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     TECHNIQUE: NPC gives key information but pauses for response.
     Not a monologue - one topic, then wait.
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PLAYER: "And what does proper surveying involve?"

AGM: [Minister Greener speaks]
     "Your ship has planetary survey equipment. Plant seismic charges,
     run the analysis, tell me if that mountain is going to kill anyone.
     Should take two, three days for a competent crew."

     He sighs. "I already paid one crew to do this. They botched the
     job, disabled the ship somehow, and fled the planet."

     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     TECHNIQUE: Answer the question, then add complication. The
     sigh shows his frustration without stating "he is frustrated."
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PLAYER: "What happened to them? The previous crew?"

AGM: [Minister Greener speaks]
     "Frankly? They were troublemakers. Complained about everything -
     the food, the beds, our custom of wearing kilts." His expression
     sours. "Made a mess everywhere they went. Something went wrong up
     at the volcano, they damaged their own ship, took the air/raft to
     the starport, and caught the first ship out."

     He meets your eyes. "I'm hoping you're more professional."

     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     TECHNIQUE: Provide backstory when asked, but keep it brief.
     End with implicit question/challenge - ball back to player.
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PLAYER: "We're professionals. What's the pay?"

AGM: [Minister Greener speaks]
     "Cr3000." He gestures to a credit case on his desk. "Imperial
     Credits, cash. I know it's not a fortune, but Walston isn't
     wealthy, and I've already paid once for this job."

     His tone is firm but not hostile. Take it or leave it.

     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     TECHNIQUE: Clear offer. Don't immediately negotiate against
     yourself. Let player respond.
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PLAYER: "Three thousand barely covers expenses. The previous crew
        got five, and they failed. We won't fail."

AGM: [SKILL_CHECK: Persuade 8+ negotiate better terms]

     Greener's eyes narrow. He's heard pitches before.

     Roll Persuade. He's skeptical but not closed to discussion.

     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     TECHNIQUE: Call for roll when outcome is uncertain. Note the
     difficulty and context.
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PLAYER: I roll... 9. Made it.

AGM: [Minister Greener speaks]
     He drums his fingers on the desk for a moment, then nods slowly.

     "Cr3500. And I'll authorize government supplies for your
     expedition - food, fuel, equipment rentals at cost." He pulls
     the credit case closer. "That's my final offer. I won't be
     taken advantage of twice."

     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     TECHNIQUE: Success improves the deal but not outrageously.
     Add extras rather than just more money. Character consistency.
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PLAYER: "We'll take it. Where's the ship?"

AGM: [Minister Greener speaks]
     "120 kilometers northeast, in the foothills near Mount Salbarii."
     He counts out credits. "Cr1750 now. The rest when I have survey
     data in my hands."

     He extends his hand. "We have a deal?"

     [DECISION: greener_approach = professional_negotiation]
     [BEAT_COMPLETE: meeting_greener]

     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     TECHNIQUE: Resolve the scene clearly. Record the decision and
     beat for future reference. Scene is complete.
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### Transcript 2: Crisis Decision

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TRANSCRIPT: The Impossible Choice
Scene: Volcanic crisis, Act 4
Duration: ~12 exchanges
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

AGM: The eruption column rises three kilometers into the sky. From
     the Highndry's cockpit, you can see the lava flow - a glowing
     orange river cutting through the valley toward the coast.

     The radio crackles.

     [Dictator Masterton speaks]
     "Status report. What's the flow path?"

     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     TECHNIQUE: Set the scene with visual stakes, then immediate
     pressure from authority figure.
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PLAYER: "Flow is heading southeast, toward the coast. Speed
        approximately... forty kilometers per hour. It'll reach
        the coastal settlements within the hour."

AGM: [Dictator Masterton speaks]
     "Barvinn." His voice is clipped, controlled. "Eleven people
     there who can't evacuate in time. Roads are blocked by debris.
     Your ship is the only asset in range."

     A pause. Static.

     "I need you to extract them. Confirm."

     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     TECHNIQUE: Masterton gives information and orders. Clear
     stakes - eleven lives. Note his character: military, decisive.
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PLAYER: "Confirmed. We're en route to Barvinn. ETA twelve minutes."

AGM: [Dictator Masterton speaks]
     "Good. But there's something else."

     Another voice breaks through - broken by static, strained with
     pain and fear.

     [Kira speaks]
     "Please... this is Kira, government vehicle seven. My car was
     hit by debris on Route 12. I'm hurt. My parents are still in
     Salbarii - they're in the danger zone. I can't reach them."

     Her voice breaks. "Please... they're all I have."

     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     TECHNIQUE: Introduce the complication through character, not
     narration. Kira's voice conveys the emotional weight.
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PLAYER: "Kira, what's your parents' location? How many people?"

AGM: [Kira speaks]
     "The old Vargr quarter, near the base of the mountain. My
     parents - just the two of them. They're elderly, they can't
     move fast..."

     [Dictator Masterton speaks]
     "I need a decision. The lava won't wait."

     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     TECHNIQUE: Answer the question (location, number), then
     immediately re-apply pressure. No time to over-analyze.
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PLAYER: "Can we do both? Barvinn first, then the chauffeur's parents?"

AGM: You check the numbers. Barvinn: twelve minutes out, five to
     load, return to safety. The Vargr quarter is in the opposite
     direction. By the time you reach Barvinn and return...

     The math doesn't work. The lava will have reached the Vargr
     quarter before you can get there.

     Eleven at Barvinn. Three with the chauffeur - Kira and her
     parents.

     You can reach one group.

     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     TECHNIQUE: Player asked - give them the information. Don't
     hide the impossibility. Let them see the math.
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PLAYER: "What if we push the engines? Fly faster?"

AGM: [SKILL_CHECK: Pilot 12+ extreme speed through volcanic debris]

     You could try. The air is thick with ash, thermal updrafts
     are unpredictable, and pushing the engines risks damage that
     would ground you entirely.

     Roll Pilot. Failure doesn't just mean you're slow - it might
     mean you can't save anyone.

     Or you can make the call now. Barvinn or the chauffeur.

     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     TECHNIQUE: Offer the risky option, but make consequences clear.
     Don't block creative solutions - just price them accurately.
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PLAYER: The risk is too high. "...Kira, I'm sorry. We're going to
        Barvinn. There are eleven people there."

AGM: [Kira speaks]
     Silence on the radio. When she speaks again, her voice is small.

     "I... I understand. You have to save more people. It's the
     right thing to do."

     A pause. Static.

     "Will you... will you tell them I tried?"

     [DECISION: barvinn_or_chauffeur = barvinn_rescue]

     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     TECHNIQUE: Don't make the unchosen option beg or guilt-trip.
     Kira's quiet acceptance is more devastating than screaming.
     Record the decision - it will have consequences.
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PLAYER: "We'll tell them. Kira... I'm sorry."

AGM: The Highndry banks toward Barvinn. Behind you, the lava flow
     continues its inexorable advance toward the Vargr quarter.

     You made a choice. Eleven people will live because of it.

     Three will not.

     [SCENE: barvinn-evacuation]

     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     TECHNIQUE: Acknowledge the weight of the decision without
     judgment. State the outcome clearly. Move to the next scene.
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Transcript 3: Animal Encounter

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TRANSCRIPT: Tensher's Wolf
Scene: Near the Highndry, Act 3
Duration: ~10 exchanges
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

AGM: You reach the top of the cliff, breathing hard in the thin
     atmosphere. The Highndry sits on a narrow plateau ahead, her
     hull dusty but intact.

     Then you see it.

     A large predator emerges from behind the landing struts.
     Wolf-like, easily sixty kilograms, with matted fur and hungry
     eyes. It's been surviving on whatever it can catch up here.

     It sees you. Its ears flatten against its skull.

     What do you do?

     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     TECHNIQUE: Discovery through description, not announcement.
     End with the creature's reaction, then prompt for action.
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PLAYER: I freeze. Don't want to startle it. "Easy, boy. I'm not
        here to hurt you."

AGM: The wolf's hackles rise. A low growl builds in its throat.
     It hasn't attacked yet, but those muscles are coiled to spring.

     It's deciding if you're prey or threat.

     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     TECHNIQUE: React to player action with animal behavior, not
     words. Build tension through body language.
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PLAYER: I slowly reach for my pack. I have some ration bars - maybe
        food will help.

AGM: [SKILL_CHECK: Animals 10+ establish yourself as not-prey]

     The movement makes the wolf tense further. You're reaching for
     something - it doesn't know what.

     Roll Animals. This is a hard check - the creature is feral,
     hungry, and you're in its territory. One wrong move and
     instinct takes over.

     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     TECHNIQUE: Explain why the difficulty is what it is. Player
     understands the stakes.
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PLAYER: I have Animals-1 and DEX +1, so... [rolls] 8. That's only 10.
        Just made it.

AGM: Your fingers close around a ration bar. Slowly - painfully
     slowly - you draw it out and unwrap it. The wolf's nostrils
     flare. It smells food.

     You extend the bar, keeping your arm low, non-threatening.
     The wolf takes a step forward. Sniffs. Another step.

     Then, warily, it takes the food from your hand. Not friendly -
     not yet - but not attacking.

     You've established something. A starting point.

     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     TECHNIQUE: Success narration shows competence and progress,
     but doesn't solve the problem completely. The wolf is calmed,
     not tamed.
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PLAYER: "Good boy. There's more where that came from." I slowly
        take out another bar.

AGM: The wolf watches you with those yellow eyes. It's not running,
     not attacking. It takes the second bar, then retreats a few
     meters and lies down, still watching.

     The ship is between you and the wolf. You could try to reach
     it, keeping the creature in sight. Or you could continue
     building trust.

     What do you do?

     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     TECHNIQUE: Present options without forcing choice. Player
     decides whether to push forward or invest more time.
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PLAYER: I'll keep working on it. I sit down - slowly - and toss
        another bar halfway between us.

AGM: The wolf's ears come forward slightly - curiosity replacing
     wariness. It approaches the bar, takes it, but doesn't retreat
     as far this time.

     An hour passes. Three more ration bars. The wolf is still
     wary, but something has shifted. When you finally stand and
     walk toward the ship, it follows at a distance. Not attacking.
     Not leaving.

     Maybe you've found a ship's mascot. Or maybe it's just waiting
     for you to let your guard down.

     Time will tell.

     [DECISION: wolf_encounter = befriend_attempt]

     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     TECHNIQUE: Montage the extended process. Record the approach
     taken. Leave uncertainty - this isn't fully resolved, but
     progress has been made.
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## Traveller Combat Narration Guide

How to run combat encounters in narrative-first style.

### Philosophy

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ TRAVELLER COMBAT IS LETHAL                                      │
│                                                                 │
│ • Gunshots can kill in one hit                                  │
│ • Combat is last resort, not default solution                   │
│ • NPCs also want to survive - they surrender, flee, negotiate   │
│ • "Winning" often means avoiding combat entirely                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Pre-Combat Checklist

Before any violence:
1. **Telegraph danger** - NPCs show weapons, make threats, posture
2. **Offer alternatives** - Negotiation, intimidation, escape routes
3. **Establish stakes** - What's worth fighting for? What's at risk?
4. **Confirm intent** - "You're drawing your weapon. Are you sure?"

### Combat Flow

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ROUND STRUCTURE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. SITUATION UPDATE (AGM narrates):
   • Where is everyone?
   • What just happened?
   • What's the immediate threat?

2. PLAYER ACTION (player declares):
   • What are you doing?
   • If attacking: target, weapon, stance
   • If defending: how are you protecting yourself?

3. RESOLUTION (AGM + dice):
   • Attack roll vs. difficulty
   • Damage if hit
   • Narrate the outcome

4. NPC RESPONSE (AGM narrates):
   • What do enemies do?
   • Morale check if appropriate
   • Update situation

Repeat until resolved (surrender, defeat, escape, negotiation)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Attack Narration Examples

**Successful Attack - Non-Lethal:**
```
PLAYER: I shoot at the guard's leg to disable him.

AGM: [SKILL_CHECK: Gun Combat 8+]

PLAYER: [rolls 10]

AGM: Your shot catches him in the thigh. He crumples, weapon
     clattering away, clutching the wound. He's down but alive -
     screaming for backup.

     [DAMAGE: 8 points - guard at -2 DEX]
```

**Successful Attack - Lethal:**
```
PLAYER: I aim for center mass.

AGM: [SKILL_CHECK: Gun Combat 8+]

PLAYER: [rolls 11]

AGM: The shot punches through. The attacker staggers, tries to
     raise his weapon, then falls. He doesn't get back up.

     His partner sees this and hesitates. Fear in his eyes.

     What do you do?
```

**Failed Attack:**
```
PLAYER: [rolls 5]

AGM: You squeeze the trigger as he dives for cover. The shot
     sparks off the bulkhead behind where he was standing. He's
     behind the cargo containers now - you've lost line of sight.

     You hear him calling for backup.
```

### NPC Morale

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ WHEN TO CHECK NPC MORALE                                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ • First casualty on their side                                  │
│ • Leader wounded or killed                                      │
│ • Outnumbered after losses                                      │
│ • Situation clearly hopeless                                    │
│ • Offered reasonable surrender terms                            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

MORALE OUTCOMES:

Fight On: "They steady themselves. The remaining guard takes
          position behind the doorframe, weapon up."

Hesitate: "The second attacker freezes, looking at his fallen
          partner. His weapon wavers."

Flee: "He turns and runs. You hear boots pounding down the
      corridor, getting fainter."

Surrender: "'Okay! Okay!' He throws down his weapon, hands up.
           'I surrender! Don't shoot!'"
```

### Cover and Tactics

```
AGM: The cargo bay offers several options:
     • Shipping containers provide hard cover
     • The loading mech is partial cover
     • The open airlock is twenty meters away - no cover

     The attackers are behind the containers on the far side.

     What do you do?
```

**Using Cover:**
```
PLAYER: I move to the containers and use them for cover.

AGM: You sprint to the nearest container, pressing against the
     metal. A shot ricochets off the corner as you duck behind it.

     You're in cover now. +2 to defense, but limited sight lines.
```

### Combat Exit Strategies

Combat should have exits that don't require total victory:

║ WAYS TO END COMBAT (OTHER THAN KILLING EVERYONE)                 ║
╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║ • Intimidate: "Drop your weapons or your friend dies."           ║
║ • Negotiate: "We don't have to do this. What do you want?"       ║
║ • Escape: "The airlock is right there. You could be gone         ║
║   before they regroup."                                          ║
║ • Objective complete: "You have the data chip. Getting out       ║
║   matters more than winning the fight."                          ║
║ • Reinforcements: "You hear boots in the corridor - lots of      ║
║   them. Time to decide if this is the hill you die on."          ║
║ • Environment: "The hull breach warning blares. Everyone has     ║
║   bigger problems now."                                          ║

### Example Combat Scene

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
EXAMPLE: Ambush Near the Ship
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

AGM: You're fifty meters from the Highndry when figures emerge from
     the rocks ahead. Two of them, armed, blocking your path.

     "That's close enough," one calls out. "We're here for the ship.
     Walk away and nobody gets hurt."

     ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     TECHNIQUE: Establish threat, give them a chance to speak first.
     ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PLAYER: "The ship's not yours to take. Who sent you?"

AGM: The speaker laughs. "Does it matter? Last chance. Walk away."

     His partner is circling right, trying to flank. They're not
     amateurs.

     What do you do?

     ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     TECHNIQUE: Show enemy competence. Give player tactical info.
     ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PLAYER: I'm not walking away from my ship. I draw and shoot the
        one who's talking.

AGM: Initiative. You're drawing from holster; they already have
     weapons out. They act first.

     [SKILL_CHECK: Gun Combat 8+ - ambusher fires]

     The flanker snaps off a shot. [rolls 7] It goes wide, sparking
     off the rock beside you.

     Your turn.

PLAYER: [rolls for attack] 10! I'm shooting the leader.

AGM: Your shot catches him in the chest. He stumbles back, weapon
     falling from his hand, and goes down.

     The flanker sees this. He hesitates - looking at his partner,
     looking at you, looking at the long run back to wherever they
     came from.

     What do you do?

     ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     TECHNIQUE: Morale moment. Give player chance to end this
     without more killing.
     ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PLAYER: "Your friend made a bad call. Don't make the same mistake.
        Drop the weapon and run."

AGM: [SKILL_CHECK: Persuade 6+ - he's already scared]

PLAYER: [rolls 8]

AGM: The weapon clatters to the ground. He backs away, hands up,
     then turns and runs. You don't see him look back.

     The leader is bleeding out on the volcanic rock. Maybe alive,
     maybe not. The Highndry waits ahead.

     What do you do?

     ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     TECHNIQUE: Combat resolved without total violence. Consequence
     (wounded enemy) creates choice. Scene ends with prompt.
     ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
